Hi,

I built my first two models the last few weeks, but because of the
weather here, didn't get to flying them. And maybe that's a good thing
because I've gotten a lot better at rc flying on CRRCSIM... :-)

For me, one of the hardest things is to get the plane back on the
ground (in one piece) after flying a few rounds... In CRRCSIM the
plane just bounces if you hit the ground. In a review I saw this is
described as "unrealistic". But technically probably the easiest
solution.

Now I was thinking: how about a "damage meter". If the reaction forces
from the ground are "measured", and the highest value encountered
displayed, then that would allow me to see an impartial measure of how
good my landing skills are getting....

So far I've found: 

  src/mod_fdm/gear01/gear.cpp

as one place where ground forces are calculated. But I have no idea
yet where to store and where to display the results. 

Moreover I think it's not always the gears that touch the ground, so
maybe this is not the place to add this.

Suggestions? Improvements?

	Roger.

This behaviour can be adjusted. You are right, the code is in 
   src/mod_fdm/gear01/gear.cpp
and is used for all kind of ground interaction (no matter whether wing or
gear hits the ground). The points used are defined in the airplanes .xml
file; see that file and the description in 
   documentation/file_format/index.html

By tweaking the parameters you might be able to produce much more realistic
behaviour.

If you are interested in how well you did the landing: it is resembled by
how much the plane bounces. So there already is a real time feedback like
you want to have.

Best regards,
Jens

Hi Roger,

for historical reasons, the whole ground contact model is located in the
"gear" module. This module keeps a list of all "hardpoints" for a plane,
no matter if they are located on the actual gear or at the wingtip or
whereever. The hardpoint locations are defined in the model's XML file.
For each hardpoint there are settings defining the friction, the spring
constant and the spring damping:

    <wheel percent_brake="0.25" caster_angle_rad="0">
      <pos x="-2.44" y="-1.28" z="0" />
      <spring constant="65" damping="0.25" />
    </wheel>

The name "wheel" is a bit misleading... It's just a hardpoint.

For a simple "crash" model, it would be sufficient to define another
parameter for each wheel that defines the maximum force that this
hardpoint can bear without breaking. The actual force can be calculated
in the "gear" module. Then one could use the EventManager to fire some
kind of "crash event", which could be picked up by any other module
(SimStateHandler, ...).

If you want to work on this, I recommend that you clone the CRRCsim
repository and prepare a patch. You can submit it via the CRRCsim
patch tracker on Berlios.de.

Regarding landing training: If you manage to land a plane without
bouncing, I think you're ready for some real flying ;-)

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Sometimes it bounces up say 2m, but that's because it's still flying
at a speed that's giving it lots of lift. So I don't agree that the
bounce height is a good indication of how hard a landing was. (you're
right: if I plow in prop-first and bounce back up 2m, then in real
life the plane would've been broken.)

Sometimes a bounce is just like a touch-and-go, and even in real life,
you'd be able to continue to fly. (i.e. nothing broken). 

	Roger.
