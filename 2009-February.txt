Hi Jan,

I mainly agree with you on the selection of models:

> biplane2.xml     ? (based on sport.xml, but nice to have a biplane)
> melyan_01.xml    remove
keep because of their different look

> k2-f3f2.xml      ?
> k2-f3f.xml       ?
> k2.xml           keep
Remove at least one of them. Which one? Olivier Bordes once added the
original k2-f3f2.air, maybe he has an opinion...

> mav0.xml         ?
remove

> mav.xml          ?
keep


Maybe those models should be (re)moved to something like addon-models so
users can still install them.

Jens

Hi Jan,

apart from what you said, there is a bug concerning the airplanes initial
position. It is where your feet are when starting from the ground and where
your head is when doing a hand launch -- this is not realistic in any case
and differs from previous CRRCSim behaviour. I don't know who changed this
and why, but I consider this a showstopper for the next release.

Jens

I filed a bug report for this one:

https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=15180&group_id=9957

I guess it was introduced by Joel's coordinate system cleanup, but I don't
know for sure. I agree that it should be fixed. For a helicopter it's
impossible to start this way.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Hi all,

removed for clarity):

#2 Verify that configuration of new functions also works on the command line. (open)
   jr: I guess that the configuration of axis functions on the command line no
       longer works (see bug #15161: it uses the same internal mechanism which
       was removed 2005). Need to verify this and maybe remove the corresponding
       CLI options.

#4 Bug #15161 --> fixed

#5 Unix manpage may need some corrections due to new input functions. (open) 
   jr: could be outdated, see #2. Nevertheless, the man page needs some
       corrections and a thorough review.

#6 New scenery selection dialog 
   --> no action, fix later. Recorded as Feature Request #4470.

#7 Experimental landscape files should not be part of the final
   distribution tarball/binary packages to avoid confusing the user.
   Verify autotools scripts. (open)
   --> The autotools scripts need to be adapted to only include
       cape_cod-orig.xml, davis-orig.xml, simple.xml and the associated
       3D models and textures.

Hello,

Since my modifications, the initial position of the plane is player
relative. This mode is adapted to the current scenes without tracks. This
position is modifiable in crrcsim.xml by launch.x and lauch.y. I had
unfortunately left these values to zero, which was not adapted to the
motorized models (sport and heli). Now, with x=y=10, that seems to be
appropriate.

I nevertheless added a commutation by launch.from_player. If
launch.from_player=0, the initial position is determined by "<start>
<position ..."  in scenery.html. This mode will be necessary for scenes with
a track of takeoff. I did not adapt the dialogue of launching to take into
account these parameters. I propose to do it later.

Jo?l

Hello Joel,

this seems to work, at least if I create a new crrcsim.xml from scratch.
Using my existing configuration the plane still appeared on my feet.
I don't know what happens if someone keeps his existing configuration
from 0.9.9 and then upgrades to 0.9.10.

For a helicopter it would be better to stand right behind it (just like
before) instead of launching with a 45 degree offset. And it won't hurt
for planes. What do you think?

Maybe we should add some more logic: If from_player=0 and there's a
<start> in the scenery.html, use this. If from_player=0 and there's
no <start>, treat this like from_player=1.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Hello Jan,

Yes, launch.x, lannch.y are not overwritten

Is OK : the parameters not present are initialised with the default values

=> default to launch.x=10, launch.y=0.

I wish the PilatusB4.xml was a model in the list from crrcsim-addon-models.
But I am okay if it doesn't make it.
I just like it a lot.

Hi all,

here's an updated TODO list (uncritical entries from my first email have
been
removed for clarity):

#2 Verify that configuration of new functions also works on the command
line. (open)
   jr: I guess that the configuration of axis functions on the command line
no
       longer works (see bug #15161: it uses the same internal mechanism
which
       was removed 2005). Need to verify this and maybe remove the
corresponding
       CLI options.

#4 Bug #15161 --> fixed

#5 Unix manpage may need some corrections due to new input functions. (open)

   jr: could be outdated, see #2. Nevertheless, the man page needs some
       corrections and a thorough review.

#6 New scenery selection dialog 
   --> no action, fix later. Recorded as Feature Request #4470.

#7 Experimental landscape files should not be part of the final
   distribution tarball/binary packages to avoid confusing the user.
   Verify autotools scripts. (open)
   --> The autotools scripts need to be adapted to only include
       cape_cod-orig.xml, davis-orig.xml, simple.xml and the associated

Hello,

Pilatus and Fox are attractive. But it seems to me that they have a bug.
Movements repeated by the rudder accelerate them.

I wish the PilatusB4.xml was a model in the list from crrcsim-addon-models.
But I am okay if it doesn't make it.
I just like it a lot.

Update:
 
#7 Experimental landscape files should not be part of the final
   distribution tarball/binary packages to avoid confusing the user.
   Verify autotools scripts. (open)
   --> The autotools scripts need to be adapted to only include
       cape_cod-orig.xml, davis-orig.xml, simple.xml and the associated
       3D models and textures.

#8 List of models needs a cleanup. Remove some, add some from addon-models.
   (done)

New files were added as proposed. The old models are still available as a
separate download:

https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=9957

So there's not much work left until I will prepare a first release
candidate.

Kind regards,

Hello,

I've completed the list of open tasks for 0.9.10 and prepared a first
release candidate from changeset 1068:f7296b405e32. You can download
the source tarball from here:

I hope that I can provide a Win32 installer built from this tarball soon.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Hi,

I just looked at the current state and at what happened in the
meantime...sorry to say that I'm highly discontent with some of the code and
config file changes. There will be a proposal (commit to hg) on how to make
it different tomorrow.

Hi,

so I pushed my changesets, they partially clean up what I didn't like.

Furthermore, they provide sensible launch defaults for every model (except
mav, see below) and provide mostly backwards-compatible behaviour. So this
is the first version which provides a working launch for every model after
selecting it, without tweaking launch settings. No sports models/heli will
fall from the sky and no glider will sit on the grass.

I added the player-relative launch position to the launch default section in
the model file and to launch presets in crrcsim.xml. The new values are
handled by crrc_launch.cpp -- however, they are not editable using the GUI yet.

'mav' can't be launched in any way, it must be started from the ground. I'll
look into it -- it has been like this since some time, though...

I recognized that one of the recent changesets changed the player position
in such a way that when doing a ground start at Davis, the initial field of
view has changed a lot -- the player has grown taller some feet.

Subject: [Crrcsim-devel] development quality expectations
Message-ID: <20090225163243.GB9970@knusper.jensens.local>

Here are some notes about the subject..maybe this is just my two cents,
maybe we can stick to it... 

 - coding style (we agreed on that some time ago)
     * no tabs
     * indentation, braces
     * no further code on if/else lines despite condition
 - no inactive (commented out) code without good reason and comment. We DO
   have a VCS.
 - code quality in general
 - don't push what's far from finished if it is visible to the user or in
   the config files and you don't manage to fix it for the next release 
 - if you messed up your local repo by adding much-too-big-files, pointless
   merge changesets or something like that: don't push. Ask on the list about
   how to fix your local repo (it is possible!), fix it, push afterwards.   
 - take a look at your changesets regarding the points above before you push 

The current state of CRRCSim is too good to leave traces of bad
coding/style, obvious regressions or something like this. And we have little
manpower -- so if we do something, it should be done right or not done at all.

If something worked (well) for a user in version A, it should work at least
equally well in version B, no matter if it is a fresh install or an upgrade.
We must not require a user to tweak config files in order to get something
working again or fix misfeatures.

Best regards,
Jens

Subject: [Crrcsim-devel] quality criteria -- why?
Message-ID: <20090225164003.GC9970@knusper.jensens.local>

Why did I write the other email, you may ask.

I feel kind of responsible for CRRCSim. Starting from 2004, Jan Reucker and
me worked A LOT to get the project to where it is now. So I can't bear to
see it degrade in any way.
BUT: the time I can spend on it is very limited, and surely this is true for
Jan, too.
For me it is really exhausting if I have to spend time on the project to fix
things caused by others. Usually the only alternative is letting it degrade
-- even writing an email (stating what's wrong) takes time.

The project needs contributors to make it move forward faster and who might
take over caring about it one day, therefore I don't want make contributing
harder. But if many contributions result in me (or Jan) having to fix things
or watching the project degrade, I'd rather keep up quality by
accepting/rejecting changesets/patches by persons acting as gatekeepers than
letting CRRCSim degrade (this development model makes contributing harder of
course).

Please keep in mind: at the moment there is nothing like CRRCSim, there is
nothing on the horizon. It is something valuable, so we should treat it like
that.

Best regards,
Jens

Hi Jens,

many thanks for your clear words. I agree to all points you stated in both
your quality related emails, and I hope that we can continue improving CRRCsim
with these points on our minds.

I hope that it's not necessary to switch to the "gatekeeper" development
model, allthough hg makes it easy for contributors to prepare patches
or export whole changesets and send them to the gatekeeper instead of
committing directly. The "gatekeeper" model puts some extra load on the
shoulders of the core team, because they have to review every incoming
piece of code. And as you already said, our time for CRRCsim is very
limited.

Well, we often talked about coding style and "best practice" development,
but I guess it's time to write it down on a wiki page. Everything was
written down in different emails, some knowledge is retained in the
astyle and indent command lines in the old Makefiles. But I should write
it down in the wiki to have it all in one place.

But before, I think that we should get 0.9.10 on the road. I hope that I can
take a look at your changes later. 

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Don't know if I got you wrong, but I strongly suggest to release 0.9.10
*including* the changes I pushed.

You are right, but if 'contributions' keep recent quality, I'd rather
act as a gatekeeper -- if quality is more important than features/changes,
then being gatekeeper means less work. I'd only accept changesets with a
clear scope and certain quality -- so there is no worrying about who fixes
things or when things will be fixed as long as they are not in the main repo.

Yes, it should be there. However, it is not of much use as long as people
don't contribute or even join the dev team.

I do not understand the warning message: the test is on "xform0",

To avoid any problem, I modified the code (pushed on hg)

Hi Joel,

these two files should not be part of the distributed tarball, as they
are only experimental and of no real use to the enduser. "simple.xml"
is experimental, too, but it should stay in the distribution to
act as an example for potential scenery builders.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Definitely. I meant that I'll provide a new RC first, and then take care
of writing down something about code quality in the wiki.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

You're right, but I think I'll get it done before CRRCsim hits the Ubuntu
repository. This might slightly increase CRRCsim's popularity, so there's
a chance that there might be a patch or two every now and then...

Kind regards,

No, the offending line 2896 read:

if( xform) sgPreMultMat4  ( xform, xform1 ) ;//Pre or Post ???

And because "sgMat4" is just an array, "xform" will evaluate to the address of
the first element, therefore always being != 0.

Thanks. But I think you didn't really fix the issue, you just told the
compiler that xform might be pointing to NULL now (by passing it in as
a parameter, the compiler loses the ability to track its value). The real
problem is that the "if" clause (now in line 2893) doesn't do anything
useful:

- it doesn't check if "xform" is all zeros
- it doesn't check if "xform" is an identity matrix
- it is always true, because you always pass a pointer to an automatic
  variable to the function (which is always != NULL)

So I suggest that you just remove the "if (xform)" or tell us what you
wanted to achieve with it so that we can think of a working solution.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

I did not look at the good line!
Now, it is clear.
It is effectively necessary to delete this test which is not any more right
of exist.

Subject: [Crrcsim-devel] Compiler warnings -- to be taken serious
Message-ID: <20090227103037.GA4205@knusper.jensens.local>

Hi there,

as I've definitely switched to cmake now, warnings become visible. There is
one related to physics in fdm_002 about which I'll care about later, as this
code is not in use.



There is one I related to 'shadow_matrix', which I'm not familiar with. Jan,
can you care about it, please? The compiler says:
  +--------------------------------------------------------
  | [ 87%] Building CXX object CMakeFiles/crrcsim.dir/src/crrc_graphics.cpp.o
  | /usr/include/plib/sg.h: In function ?void makeShadowMatrix(float (*)[4], float, float)?:

  |   dst [ 2 ] = src [ 2 ] ;
  | }
  | 
  | inline void sgCopyVec4 ( sgVec4 dst, const sgVec4 src )
  | {
  |   dst [ 0 ] = src [ 0 ] ;
  |   dst [ 1 ] = src [ 1 ] ;
  |   dst [ 2 ] = src [ 2 ] ;
  |   dst [ 3 ] = src [ 3 ] ;      // this is line 291
  | }
  | 
  |

  | {
  |   dst [ 0 ] += src [ 0 ] ;
  |   dst [ 1 ] += src [ 1 ] ;
  | }
  +--------------------------------------------------------


  
There was another bug like that in handlerF3F.cpp, I fixed it.



Some more warnings (I will not care about those):



[ 51%] Building CXX object src/mod_landscape/CMakeFiles/mod_landscape.dir/ssgLoadJPG.cpp.o
src/mod_landscape/ssgLoadJPG.cpp: In function ?bool ssgLoadJPG(const char*, ssgTextureInfo*)?:
src/mod_landscape/ssgLoadJPG.cpp:62: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions






Joel, this related to what I already asked you to do: indent your code,
remove code you have commented out and unused variables due to that:

[ 48%] Building CXX object src/mod_windfield/CMakeFiles/mod_windfield.dir/windfield.cpp.o
src/mod_windfield/windfield.cpp: In function ?int calculate_wind(double, double, double, double&, double&, double&)?:

[  3%] Building CXX object src/mod_chardevice/CMakeFiles/mod_chardevice.dir/chardevicewrapper.cpp.o

src/mod_chardevice/chardevicewrapper.cpp: In member function ?int CharDeviceWrapper::run_script(const char*)?:

Best regards,
Jens

Hi Jens,

sure, I'll take care of this. And I'll also take a look at the chardevice
issue.

Joel, instead of indenting your code manually, I recommend using astyle
or indent. I guess you don't have them at hand on Windows, shall I do
it for you (no problem)?

Kind regards,
Jan R.

I thought of making these modifications (indent...)  after the version 9.10.
If you think useful to make it at once, I could take charge of it tomorrow.
No problem, obviously, if Jan has time to advance the work!

I think the most important issue is fixing the remaining compiler warnings,
but it would be nice if you could fix the indentation as well. Using astyle
or indent it's just a matter of some minutes.

One problem is that we all seem to use different versions of g++. On Windows
you're usually stuck at version 3.4.5 (I don't know if the 4.x.x packages
are stable enough). On Ubuntu I'm using 4.3.2. Jens, which version are you
using? 4.3.2 didn't report the (serious) issue with the sgVec's.

This issue and the two warnings in CharDeviceWrapper should be fixed now.
I can't confirm it for the sgVec issue with g++ 4.3.2...

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Hi Jens,

so you're using the same gcc version. Strange. Does cmake use any additional compiler flags to enable stricter checking?

Kind regards,
