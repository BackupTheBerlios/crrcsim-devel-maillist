&gt;<i> &gt; I've tried to recover as much of the file's &quot;C&quot; history as possible. The authors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of some .c files that were converted to .cpp and deleted from CVS are not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; preserved in the hg repo (shame on CVS for not providing a &quot;move&quot; command).
</I>&gt;<i> So we can't look them up in CVS anymore? 
</I>
You can still look them up (I used the web interface at SF.net which allows you
to show &quot;dead files&quot;). But they're not linked to their .cpp counterparts,
because CVS does not care about moving files. We moved the files locally,
deleted the .c files and added the .cpp files, so the history that is preserved
in hg starts from the point where the file was added as .cpp.
 
&gt;<i> Yeah, that's similar to the previous paragraph: our copyright/author history
</I>&gt;<i> is lossy. But I'll think about that later (when I got a feeling of how bad
</I>&gt;<i> it is).
</I>
Well, I don't think it's that bad. I think for the fdm_larcsim parts you can
easily lookup the original authors from the &quot;dead&quot; ls_*.[ch] files in CVS.

One thing we don't know, however, is the license under which LarcSim originally
was released. Bruce Jackson didn't provide any licensing information in
his original files. I already talked with Jan K. about this issue. Maybe we
can contact Bruce directly. I guess there shouldn't be any problems, because
other projects like FlightGear also use his code.

Finally, I don't think it's a problem if the history of a couple of files isn't
listed 100% bullet proof in the header. The repositories at SF.net and BerliOS
are open to the public, so anybody interested in the exact history can dig
through it.

Kind regars,
Jan R.
