<PRE>Hello to the CRRCsim developers, Jan Kansky may have already told you
that I have been in contact with him already if not I shall start from
the top. My name is Chris and I am an Ubuntu developer in training who
has accepted the task of packaging your application for usage in the
Ubuntu repositories which will later be ported over to the Debian ones.
There is however a minor problem with the source tarball of your
application regarding the packaging process. Both the Ubuntu &amp; Debian
archives are very strict on maintaining copyrights to the respectful
owners, that is where the issue comes into place with this project.
Unfortunately their policy requires that each individual source-code
file, .cpp, .h &amp; even .xml in the project has a header containing the
copyright holder of the file and the license of it, note that a single
file can have many copyright holders and multiple different files can
have different licenses all within the same project.

Ideally for the project to be included, what we are looking for is to
have a licence header, just like the source-codes under /chardevice.
This will enable us to get around the legalities of including your
software in our mirrors. Here is a copy of what we, the Ubuntu/Debian
packagers are meant to write in each package as an example (note that
this one was written by my Ubuntu developer mentor):
<A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/k/kde-style-domino/current/copyright">http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/k/kde-style-domino/current/copyright</A>

As you can see, there are two licenses, the GPLv2 and the GPLv3 in that
project as well as having multiple copyright owners over multiple
directories. If possible could you release a new upstream tarball with
the respected copyright clearly shown in each source-file. If you have
any questions at all, please feel free to email me back directly or
through this mailing list.

Thanks for your time for reading this,
Chris.
