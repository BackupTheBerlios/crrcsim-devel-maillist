<PRE>Hi Jo&#235;l,

&gt;<i>  - The importation of the wind is a little slow. The current file is
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessarily large but in 3D it will be necessarily large. This slowness
</I>&gt;<i> does not seem to me really awkward but it would be useful to post a window
</I>&gt;<i> of waiting during the loading of scene. 
</I>
&gt;<i> [..]
</I>
&gt;<i> I pushed source and data file on Berlios. It will be well to remove the
</I>&gt;<i> large files xxx.rgb en scnery/Brie. Jens ?
</I>
This is no good news after being offline for about eight weeks...but I'm
back (some weeks of hard work and having no internet connection because of
me moving, four weeks being on holiday) and got telephone and internet
access just today. However, I won't have as much time to spend on CRRCSim as
before anytime soon.

Some thoughts and facts:
 - every single dev should talk to other devs BEFORE adding big files to the
   official repository. 
   The recent additions made the whole history of CRRCSim (including every
   revision of every single file) grow from 12MB to about 100MB by adding
   twelve files which sum up to more than 100MB (yes, the whole repo is
   smaller than one revision of just those files because it is compressed).
   'hg' even issues a warning if one adds files as big as in this case, but
   apparently it has been ignored.
 - Even the addition of the 'unnecessarily large' wind data seems odd to me.
   This data is used for a method which is not 'state of the art' (fixed
   direction of wind) although another dev (Jan) already announced that he
   has/has played with a method which might be used to calculate the windfield
   of any terrain/wind direction.
   So why pollute the official repo with such big and intermediate data?
 - intermediate/highly experimental code versions should not be pushed to the
   official repo. It is possible to make them available in some other way.
 - it is hard(...impossible) to strip history from distributed repositories,
   as they are distributed and one person is only able to strip his own
   repos, but not those of other people -- so when they push back to the
   official repo, the bad history may be back again
 - rewriting history has unwanted side effects (lots of work, at least)
 - Luckily not that much has happened and there is a little number of devs,
   so one/I can create a line of development in the repo which does not include
   the big files. But: 
     1. without help of the berlios staff it is not possible
        to strip the obsolete and big parts of the history. So we have to
        live with big repos for some time and hope that noone will ever push
        the unwanted history back to the official repo again
     2. every dev who has pulled this obsolete history is requested (and
        cannot be forced) to strip it from his own repo before pushing to 
        the official repo        

So lets see what I can do...

hg co 33569991f606
hg debugsetparents b5d92059e2b0

...

well, no, I've got better things to do.

Jo&#235;l, please do a 
  hg co b5d92059e2b0
and replay your changes (without the big files, please do think about the
windfield thing, too), then push to the official repo again. It will have
one more head then. 
Contact berlios staff and request them to do a 
  hg strip 33569991f606
on our official repository to delete the unwanted line of development.

not amused,
Jens
