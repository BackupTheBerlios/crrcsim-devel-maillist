<PRE>Firstly, I present to you my excuse for my awkwardness. I had not understood
that the transfer of large data files increased in an irreversible way the
size of the history of Mercurial. Thank you in Jens to have proposed a
solution.

I transferred my modifications again. Without any large data file. I put
them on a personal site while waiting for a better solution. (See
scenery/Brie/ReadMe.txt)

Some comments on the solution chosen for the wind, in answer to the
questions of Jan and Jens:

- The quality of CRRCSIM is the realism of the fly. That is obtained by the
use of external software of simulation (AVL). I aim to preserve this realism
for the sites of slope soaring by the use of software of aerodynamic
simulation of the slope. (<A HREF="http://jugiraud1.free.fr/brie.htm">http://jugiraud1.free.fr/brie.htm</A>).

- The problem is that the result of this simulation cannot be summarized by
only some coefficients. It is necessary to cover the space of flight by data
in 3 dimensions. To reduce the volume of these data, they are taken on a no
uniform grid. But that complicates the retrieval the data close to a point
of space. I noted that the interpolation is essential. To make this
interpolation of no regular data, a good technique is to carry out a
triangulation. The interpolation in a specified point then consists to seek
the triangle containing this point and to interpolate the values of the tops
linearly. (In 3D, the triangles become tetrahedrons.)

- I thought of calculating the triangulation at the outside of CRRCSIM but
that increases much the volume of the data file. I then found this library
CGAL which makes very well the triangulation and the search for tetrahedron.
The interface of the functions used is very simple (windata3D.cpp). It thus
seems preferable to me to use this library rather than to &quot;reinvent the
wheel&quot;.
I did not have any difficulty to install it under Windows and Msys (.
/config; make).

- To recopy only the useful parts? I can test but I fear that is not easy
for CGAL. That is probably easier for libJPEG.

- Note, I envisaged to be able to compile CRRCSIM without importation of the
data of wind and thus without CGAL (see windata3D.h).


Cordially,

Jo&#235;l
