<PRE>Why did I write the other email, you may ask.

I feel kind of responsible for CRRCSim. Starting from 2004, Jan Reucker and
me worked A LOT to get the project to where it is now. So I can't bear to
see it degrade in any way.
BUT: the time I can spend on it is very limited, and surely this is true for
Jan, too.
For me it is really exhausting if I have to spend time on the project to fix
things caused by others. Usually the only alternative is letting it degrade
-- even writing an email (stating what's wrong) takes time.

The project needs contributors to make it move forward faster and who might
take over caring about it one day, therefore I don't want make contributing
harder. But if many contributions result in me (or Jan) having to fix things
or watching the project degrade, I'd rather keep up quality by
accepting/rejecting changesets/patches by persons acting as gatekeepers than
letting CRRCSim degrade (this development model makes contributing harder of
course).

Please keep in mind: at the moment there is nothing like CRRCSim, there is
nothing on the horizon. It is something valuable, so we should treat it like
that.

Best regards,
Jens
