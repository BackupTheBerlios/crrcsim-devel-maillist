<PRE>Hi,

I just pushed a small change in mod_landscape that should unify all coordinate
systems in CRRCsim scenery files. Now viewpoints, sky box faces and objects
are defined in the same way (using north/east/height coordinates), and the
orientation fits into other parts of CRRCsim (e.g. wind direction). Rotation
of objects is now similar to the FDM: if you load an airplane as a static
model into the scenery, &quot;h&quot; will control the model's heading, &quot;p&quot; will control
rotation around the pitch axis and &quot;r&quot; will roll the model around the longitudinal
axis.

I converted all model based sceneries in the scenery folder to the new orientation,
and I hope that everything still looks allright. Joel, I think you will have to
make a change to your Brie scenery to adapt it to the new orientation:

old axis    new axis
   x          east
   y          north
   z          height

Pitch and roll are inverted. Heading is inverted and rotated by 180 degrees:

old heading   new heading
     0            180
    90             90
   180              0
   270            270

I think it's o.k. to implement these changes without increasing the scenery file
format version number. The format was never fully specified and documented,
so let's change the existing sceneries and stick with version 3.

During testing I noticed that loading an airplane as a static object in a scenery
will heavily increase CPU load. Even a simple model like the allegro made it
impossible to use CRRCsim on my netbook. The big number of triangles and the
fact that we make a full H.O.T. intersection test for each hardpoint leads
to extreme calculation efforts. Terrain tiling doesn't help here, because many
triangles will be focussed on one grid cell. I guess I'll implement a feature
that makes it possible to load transparent objects as collision boxes. Then a
complicated object can be excluded from H.O.T. calculations, and a transparent
box can provide approximated height values.

Kind regards,
Jan R.
