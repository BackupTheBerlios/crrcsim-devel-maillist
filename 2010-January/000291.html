Summary: wind direction and rotor disc: buggy since 91f79a2b02ab

Details: Starting with changeset 91f79a2b02ab, I see the following at davis(model based):
 - rotor disc looks strange
 - wind direction and fuel indicator sometimes disappear, sometimes only grey  disc remains visible

ubuntu 9.04, intel graphics

Comment:
I just meant to add a more specific description, but have been faster...

I experienced this with qc01 at davis, which easily shows the rotor-disc thingy just like you described it.

I have never seen the 'disappearing indicator' before, and 91f79a2b02ab is clearly different to its parent (0c58872541e2) in this case. Please try it out.

Regarding CRRCSim's traditional sceneries, this changeset creates more problems than it does solve (flying behind the frequency board is not a problem in 0c58872541e2) , so I think it should be backout-ed for now.

Comment:
These issues are not related to each other:
1.) The strange look of the rotor disc is indeed caused by changeset 91f79a2b02ab. The problem is that translucent polygons affect the z buffer (just like opaque polygons). This means that the rendering order is important: If a far polygon is rendered first, and then a near and translucent polygon is rendered in front of it, the far polygon will &quot;shine through&quot;. The other way round, if the near polygon is rendered first, the far polygon will fail the z buffer test and will not be written to the color buffer.

The rendering order was changed in this changeset, so the airplane will now be rendered before the scenery. This means that if you look through the rotor disc, you will no longer see the scenery, but the sky (that was rendered before the airplane). The scenery will fail the z buffer test against the rotor disc.

But on the other hand, you can now see the airplane through scenery billboards (like the frequency board, the trees in davis and so on). I'll think about possible ways to fix this.

Here's some good reading on the problem, which also explains why PLIB doesn't do alpha sorting (what many people recommend as the ultimate fix for this problem): <A HREF="http://www.sjbaker.org/steve/omniv/alpha_sorting.html">http://www.sjbaker.org/steve/omniv/alpha_sorting.html</A>

2.) The disappearing indicator issue is not caused by 91f79a2b02ab, but was visible a long time before. I've already put it on my task list for the next release (see <A HREF="http://crrcsim.berlios.de/wiki/index.php?n=CRRCsim.TaskList">http://crrcsim.berlios.de/wiki/index.php?n=CRRCsim.TaskList</A>), but didn't have the time to hunt down the bug yet.
