Hi,

I built my first two models the last few weeks, but because of the
weather here, didn't get to flying them. And maybe that's a good thing
because I've gotten a lot better at rc flying on CRRCSIM... :-)

For me, one of the hardest things is to get the plane back on the
ground (in one piece) after flying a few rounds... In CRRCSIM the
plane just bounces if you hit the ground. In a review I saw this is
described as &quot;unrealistic&quot;. But technically probably the easiest
solution.

Now I was thinking: how about a &quot;damage meter&quot;. If the reaction forces
from the ground are &quot;measured&quot;, and the highest value encountered
displayed, then that would allow me to see an impartial measure of how
good my landing skills are getting....

So far I've found: 

  src/mod_fdm/gear01/gear.cpp

as one place where ground forces are calculated. But I have no idea
yet where to store and where to display the results. 

Moreover I think it's not always the gears that touch the ground, so
maybe this is not the place to add this.

Suggestions? Improvements?

	Roger.
