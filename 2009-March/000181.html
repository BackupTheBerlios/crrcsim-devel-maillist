Hi Jerry,

this problem shows up in several dialogs, but I don't think that it's really
a showstopper for the 0.9.10 release. We can easily change the color theme
of the GUI for more contrast. It could even be made adjustable.

&gt;<i> I am wondering if we need a key to toggle full screen?  Like maybe f?
</I>
Maybe. But this is Linux-specific. On Windows, you currently can't switch
between video modes on-the-fly without reloading the whole OpenGL context.
This is not yet implemented in CRRCsim.
 
&gt;<i> I did have a time that I couldn't get out of the program and had to turn off
</I>&gt;<i> the box to get out.  I haven't been able to recreate the problem.
</I>
Did CRRCsim still run or was it some kind of xserver lockup/freeze?

&gt;<i> I had to change the crrcsim.spec file for Fedora 10, and I am wondering if
</I>&gt;<i> there is a way to add the version number to the file?
</I>
I've updated the files in my local repository. As Fedora 6 and 8 are a
bit outdated I decided to put both files into the main packages/Fedora
directory and remove 6 and 8 from the tarball. They are still in the
repository if someone needs them.

&gt;<i> I am not sure what we need/use any of the Makefile, Makefile.am, Makefile.in
</I>&gt;<i> files in any of the Fedora directories.  Do we?
</I>
The Makefiles are needed to control the distribution of files, although
nothing has to be built inside these directories.
 
&gt;<i> Also it seems like some of the required packages has changed.
</I>&gt;<i> Like freeglut is gone.  Not sure I have all of the required stuff in the
</I>&gt;<i> spec file.
</I>
Glut is gone, yes. And we've added a new dependency on libjpeg, and an optional
dependency on CGAL. So maybe you have to add this dependency manually before
building the final RPM, or you trust on libjpeg being installed on every
Linux system (which should be pretty much o.k. I guess).

Kind regards,
Jan R.
