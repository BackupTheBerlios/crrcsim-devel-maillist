</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the select location box it is really hard to tell what you have
</I>&gt;<i> selected.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It looks like there are some menus that show a like 3D box and others
</I>&gt;<i> there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; seems to be a very light change in color.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Jerry,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> this problem shows up in several dialogs, but I don't think that it's
</I>&gt;<i> really
</I>&gt;<i> a showstopper for the 0.9.10 release. We can easily change the color theme
</I>&gt;<i> of the GUI for more contrast. It could even be made adjustable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am wondering if we need a key to toggle full screen?  Like maybe f?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe. But this is Linux-specific. On Windows, you currently can't switch
</I>&gt;<i> between video modes on-the-fly without reloading the whole OpenGL context.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not yet implemented in CRRCsim.
</I>
It seems like it just causes me problems if I click on it and I can't seem
to go back.  It could be a vbox thing since that is what I was using to test
it.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I did have a time that I couldn't get out of the program and had to turn
</I>&gt;<i> off
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the box to get out.  I haven't been able to recreate the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Did CRRCsim still run or was it some kind of xserver lockup/freeze?
</I>
CRRCsim was running just fine, I just couldn't get &lt;ESC&gt; or q to work.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I had to change the crrcsim.spec file for Fedora 10, and I am wondering
</I>&gt;<i> if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is a way to add the version number to the file?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've updated the files in my local repository. As Fedora 6 and 8 are a
</I>&gt;<i> bit outdated I decided to put both files into the main packages/Fedora
</I>&gt;<i> directory and remove 6 and 8 from the tarball. They are still in the
</I>&gt;<i> repository if someone needs them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am not sure what we need/use any of the Makefile, Makefile.am,
</I>&gt;<i> Makefile.in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; files in any of the Fedora directories.  Do we?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Makefiles are needed to control the distribution of files, although
</I>&gt;<i> nothing has to be built inside these directories.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also it seems like some of the required packages has changed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Like freeglut is gone.  Not sure I have all of the required stuff in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spec file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Glut is gone, yes. And we've added a new dependency on libjpeg, and an
</I>&gt;<i> optional
</I>&gt;<i> dependency on CGAL. So maybe you have to add this dependency manually
</I>&gt;<i> before
</I>&gt;<i> building the final RPM, or you trust on libjpeg being installed on every
</I>&gt;<i> Linux system (which should be pretty much o.k. I guess).
</I>
I did take Glut out and added libjpeg to the spec file so we should be good.
When you install the rpm is should complain and not install if you don't
have everything you need.  So it is nice to get it right.  Because you don't
want it to install and then need something and break.

I have Linux installed as another boot, but my sound card is too new so
their aren't drivers for it yet.  That is part of the reason for
running/testing under a virtual machine.

Sounds like with the changes you made we should be good to go.
Will you take out the rc2 from the version line in the spec files when you
are ready to release?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Jan R.
