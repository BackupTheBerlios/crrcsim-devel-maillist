<PRE>In the select location box it is really hard to tell what you have selected.
It looks like there are some menus that show a like 3D box and others there
seems to be a very light change in color.

I am wondering if we need a key to toggle full screen?  Like maybe f?

I did have a time that I couldn't get out of the program and had to turn off
the box to get out.  I haven't been able to recreate the problem.

I had to change the crrcsim.spec file for Fedora 10, and I am wondering if
there is a way to add the version number to the file?
The &quot;Version: 0.9.10rc2&quot; line needs to change for the version, so rc2 needs
to be removed when this is released.

I also had to change the CRRCsim.desktop file because things have moved
some.

I have attached both files.  I think the CRRCsim.desktop file can just
replace the one that is there.

I am not sure what we need/use any of the Makefile, Makefile.am, Makefile.in
files in any of the Fedora directories.  Do we?

I just pull out the 2 files crrcsim.spec and CRRCsim.desktop and use the
original crrcsim-XXX.tar.gz file and run rpmbuild on it.

Also it seems like some of the required packages has changed.
Like freeglut is gone.  Not sure I have all of the required stuff in the
spec file.

Thanks for all your work!
Jerry Williams
