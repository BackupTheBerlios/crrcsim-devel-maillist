Hi,

now that we have a near-perfect model for the Flexifly (do you have an
adjusted XML file that contains the new prop position and downthrust values?),
maybe we could close the circle back to the &quot;few models&quot; thread. I still
have that &quot;finish the Flexifly tutorial in the Wiki&quot; task on my list of open
points. So maybe we can put everything together now to finish the last
page. I guess my input files weren't that bad, maybe I can compare them to
your automagically created files to spot any severe differences. Then
you could maybe describe how you (or your tool) runs AVL to get the desired
output. Which commands to execute, which constraints to set, and so on.
And then the final step, which value from AVL goes where in the XML file.

All the plans for user-friendly tools are nice and I'd really appreciate
if something like this would be available in the near future, but until then
it would be quite helpful for all of us if there was at least one example
describing the workflow for creating a model. From measuring stuff on your
own airplane to test-flying it in CRRCsim. No matter how many tools are
involved in between, as long as anybody willing to do it actually can do it.

Kind regards,
Jan R.
