<PRE>&gt;<i> On the other
</I>&gt;<i> hand, playback must be still enhanced reliability. Here are several
</I>&gt;<i> remarks, of uneven importance.
</I>I had been both in a hurry and worked too much last week, so every changeset
before 
            51ea41dfaf88   2010-03-20 12:15 +0100
            another regression fix...
has been more or less buggy.
Can you make sure your comments (the one I do not reply to below) are not
related to earlier versions? 

&gt;<i> -In the dialogue &quot; Load robots &quot;, if we click &quot;OK&quot; without having
</I>&gt;<i> selected of file:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The file could not be loaded by any FDM.
</I>&gt;<i> They said:
</I>&gt;<i>   Not CRRC_AirplaneSim_Playback: error opening infile
</I>&gt;<i> Erreur de segmentation&quot;
</I>This was an error with the current version, too. Fixed in f71a10c1c4cf,
pushed just now.

&gt;<i> *If we replay a flight in &quot;shadow&quot; mode, we obtain two shadows. Is it
</I>&gt;<i> wanted?
</I>I don't know what you try to say. 
It is possible and wanted to have more than robot, and it is possible and
wanted to have robots in demo mode.
Could you please explain in other words/more detail?

&gt;<i> *If we replay a flight in mode &quot;demo, replacing to use&quot; the command
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Remove all robots&quot; is ineffective.
</I>Yes, indeed. You have to load an airplane to regain user input. It would be
possible to change this, but robot and demo are different things, so I
wouldn't want to mix them here...

&gt;<i> *At the end of a &quot;replay&quot;, the &quot;shadow&quot; congeals in the position of the
</I>&gt;<i> last image. It is not very elegant if it was still in flight.
</I>Yes, that's right. I don't plan to change this. Changing it would mean that
some new things have to be introduced: src/robots.cpp needs to know when a
flight log has ended in order to remove the visualization, just to recreate
it on reset. That's a lot of complexity for a small enhancement, I think.

&gt;<i> *It is not easy to know how to choose what of the automatic recordings
</I>&gt;<i> is the most recent. (Is it really useful to have any of it?)
</I>Well...if you forgot to give a useful name before ending a flight, you can
still quit crrcsim, rename files and thereby save your log. This is why I
wanted to have more than just the current flight log.

&gt;<i> *The name &quot;robot&quot; is not (in my opinion ) easy to understand. It seems
</I>&gt;<i> to me that &quot;Flight recorder&quot; would be better.
</I>&gt;<i> *Is it necessary to create a specific menu? It could be in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Simulation&quot;. 
</I>It is not necessary to use a new menu, but I thought it's easier to
understand. I did not use something like &quot;load flight log&quot; and &quot;remove all
shadow planes&quot; because the current menus and code can be used unchanged for
something like a remote player or any other plane not controlled by the
primary user. Once we have something like this, we'd need to go back to
something similar like the current state.
I understand that this abstract view of things is not easy as long as there
is just flight log/shadow plane...

Thanks for your comments,
Jens
