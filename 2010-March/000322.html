<PRE>&gt;<i> The other error stays: error XML after several reset in mode &quot; shadow &quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> It is maybe that the automatic recording is made on the file in the
</I>&gt;<i> course of reading.( See also my suggestion on the names of files at the
</I>&gt;<i> end of this message)
</I>I see -- you used one of the recordXXXX.crrclog files to playback as a
shadow? Actually, this will fail, yes. 

Maybe it would be better to hide those automatic files from the user, so he
won't get confused by files he has not created/saved. So saving previous
runs might be for power users.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; *If we replay a flight in mode &quot;demo, replacing to use&quot; the command
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;Remove all robots&quot; is ineffective.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, indeed. You have to load an airplane to regain user input. It would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible to change this, but robot and demo are different things, so I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wouldn't want to mix them here...
</I>&gt;<i> To oblige to change plane to leave the demo mode did not adorn me
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable. We cannot add a command &quot;Stop the demo mode&quot; ?
</I>Yes, would be possible, but means additional work/complexity. I'd rather add
a helpful comment to the load dialog.


&gt;<i> I had not well understood how worked the &quot;Save Flight Log As&quot; command.
</I>&gt;<i> I am not on that it is the most practical. It is not before but after
</I>&gt;<i> the run which the player will want to save.
</I>It is not before, you are right. One wants to save a flight as soon as one
recognizes that a flight is worth saving -- which will surely happen
during this flight. This is how it works now: once you recognize it is worth
saving, you give it a name and a comment (both of which can be changed as
long as the flight is not over yet) and just go on. You don't have to
remember to save it when it's over.

&gt;<i> And without having to leave the simulator to look where are logfiles and
</I>&gt;<i> which is the last one!
</I>Indeed, seems you didn't understand how it works.


&gt;<i> Thus, I suggest to modify the &quot;Save Flight Log As&quot; command so that it
</I>&gt;<i> rename the last automatic recording. It would be more in compliance with
</I>&gt;<i> the functioning of most of the software: one work and we save then. 
</I>I disagree. When I start working on a file, I'll save it for the first time
WHILE working on it. Your proposal is like working on file A, closing file A
without saving, start working on file B, and then giving a name to file A.
I'm glad computer programs don't work like this. 

&gt;<i> We could add an option to choose one of the last ones.
</I>I agree that a 'hey, me stupid idiot forgot to save the last flight, can I
do it now?' - command might make sense. But this is only for people who are
overly oblivious.

&gt;<i> A additional suggestion would be to increment always the number of the
</I>&gt;<i> automatic recordings (and erasing the oldest) so that the chronology is
</I>&gt;<i> evident.
</I>Well, no. I'll rather hide them.

.....

I just pushed two changesets: hiding automatic record files and more verbose
GUI.
