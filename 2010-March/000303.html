<PRE>&gt;<i> Good idea (as usual...)! It's something really useful, and I guess you know the related
</I>&gt;<i> feature requests.
</I>sometime ago I might have read them, but I'll do it again at once

&gt;<i> Getting an additional model (at least its visual representation) is easy,
</I>&gt;<i> it's allready prepared in mod_video. Just use Video::new_visualization() to
</I>&gt;<i> load the graphics, Video::set_position() to update its position and and
</I>&gt;<i> Video::delete_visualization() when you're done. 
</I>Oh, that's great.

&gt;<i> But I guess you already know
</I>&gt;<i> that and are more likely thinking about the general design changes and extensions
</I>&gt;<i> needed to manage more than one plane...
</I>I did not know -- but I knew that graphics and related is out of my scope,
as well as general design is not only up to me, so I'm thinking out loud ;-)


&gt;<i> A good design decision here would
</I>&gt;<i> make adding things like multiplayer a breeze; I guess it wouldn't matter
</I>&gt;<i> if the data controlling the plane came from a network interface instead
</I>&gt;<i> from a file.
</I>This is what I posted some ten minutes ago, too.

&gt;<i> To provide any more concrete ideas, I'd need to look at your changes. The
</I>&gt;<i> last few weeks were pretty busy, so I had no time for CRRCsim (although I
</I>&gt;<i> promised to think about a clean interface for the wind simulation code).
</I>&gt;<i> I hope that this changes after the next week. 
</I>I'll keep posting my thoughts and committing changesets once I feel the code
is not plain silly. It'll remain in the feature branch until it is finished
and accepted, though.

Thanks a lot for your fast reply,
Jens
