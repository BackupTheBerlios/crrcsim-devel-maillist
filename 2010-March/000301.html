<PRE>This post is just me writing while I'm thinking about it...

Aircraft(src/aircraft.cpp) loads 3D model and FDM, it is directly called
from crrc_main.cpp's &quot;void loadAirplane()&quot;. 

There could be a second instance of Aircraft (for shadow mode).
Aircraft::load() could be told about shadow mode by giving a non-empty file
name for a recorded flight; in this case 
 - Aircraft would load the fdm before loading the 3D model
 - CRRC_AirplaneSim_Playback could expose XML data from the recorded file's 
   header 
 - now Aircraft can load the 3D model, as the filename is known
 
This could be repeated for any number of &quot;shadow planes&quot; by letting the user
open many recorded files. We could go further: the recorded file can be
identified by its header (well, not yet, but this is easy and already prepared
for) and may not even be a recorded file. It could contain settings for
an FDM which is a &quot;robot player&quot; or gets its data from the network.
CRRCSim could export data of its manually controlled airplane to a server or
another client, while displaying another airplane after loading its network
settings from a file.

While loading a file, the user should be able to select whether this file
replaces the manually controlled airplane or whether it is a &quot;shadow plane&quot;.
It must also be possible to remove one of the existing &quot;Aircraft&quot;s.

But this is sligthly more than I'm planning to do; it is just thinking
whether it can be extended and how it could work.

Best regards,
Jens
