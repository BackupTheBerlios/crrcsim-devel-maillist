<PRE>
&gt;<i>  The color difference of selected items in the GUI dialogs compared to unselected items is very small,
</I>&gt;<i>  which makes it hard to use some parts of the GUI (e.g. the scenery selection dialog).
</I>
There are several versions of puListBox.cxx with different behavior !

Under Linux / Ubuntu I have plib-1.8.4. The selected item is drawn in
white, the others in black. The contrast between selected player and not
selected player is thus very good, but the selected text is little
readable with the light gray bottom used at present. It is thus
necessary to make it darker.

Under Window, I have plib-1.8.5. The selected item has an average color
between two colors which one can choose (PUCOL_LABEL and
PUCOL_BACKGROUND). The only way of improving the contrast between
selected player and not selected player is to modify PUCOL_BACKGROUND.
For example red. But it makes an outline not desirable. To eliminate
this outline, it is necessary to modify the style to eliminate the 3D
outline. 

I made modifications which seem to me acceptable in 2 cases. To make
better and have an appearance independent from the version of Plib, it
is necessary to import and to modify the code source of puListBox in
source. I verified that it compiles  with no problem but is it
acceptable?
