Subject: [Crrcsim-devel] Moving away from berlios...
Message-ID: <20111002181658.GA3607@knusper>

Hi there,

berlios will be closed at the end of this year.

Some time ago we moved from sourceforge to berlios because sf didn't
allow/provide mercurial hosting; however, we didn't delete crrcsim at
sf and the mailing lists and everything are still alive.


=== source code repository

As of today its mercurial support is better than what we have at
berlios now; it provides everything else we need, so we just move back.

crrcsim's source code has already been cloned to sf; please edit your
.hg/hgrc, insert

  default = http://crrcsim.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/crrcsim/crrcsim
  default-push = ssh://USERNAME at crrcsim.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/crrcsim/crrcsim

(replace USERNAME) and remove or rename the entries pointing to berlios.

Due to mercurial's distributed nature it is not a problem if you
accidentially push to berlios -- you can always push to sf later on or
someone else can pull from berlios and push to sf, so no changeset
will be lost.


=== wiki 

Jan R. will care about that.


=== mailing list

Please use crrcsim-devel at lists.sourceforge.net instead of
crrcsim-devel at lists.berlios.de from now on.

Is it neccessary to download mails from berlios and archive them
somewhele? It is possible: 

  rsync -av lists.berlios.de::<listname>-archive <listname>-archive

  
=== tracker: bugs, patches

It is possible to export tracker items:
  
  http://developer.berlios.de/docman/display_doc.php?docid=2055&group_id=2#tracker

But can we easily import them to the sf tracker?


=== something else?

There is a package crrcsim-legacy-models on berlios.

Well, maybe there is something more that needs to be migrated? I don't
know.



Best regards,
Jens

I've already tested pulling, seems to work flawlessly.

I've found pm2media, a converter from pmwiki to mediawiki. But it 
doesn't work out-of-the box because the MediaWiki accounts at SF.net 
seem to be tightly coupled to the SF.net accounts, so the login process 
is non-standard. Maybe I have to write my own script for this task.

Don't know. A quick google search turned up nothing useful.

We should update the latest binary releases (or simply make a new 
release soon).

Kind regards,
Jan R.
