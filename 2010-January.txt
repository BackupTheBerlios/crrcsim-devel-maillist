Subject: [Crrcsim-devel] Unified coordinate systems
Message-ID: <20100109231440.71bfa238@web.de>

Hi,

I just pushed a small change in mod_landscape that should unify all coordinate
systems in CRRCsim scenery files. Now viewpoints, sky box faces and objects
are defined in the same way (using north/east/height coordinates), and the
orientation fits into other parts of CRRCsim (e.g. wind direction). Rotation
of objects is now similar to the FDM: if you load an airplane as a static
model into the scenery, "h" will control the model's heading, "p" will control
rotation around the pitch axis and "r" will roll the model around the longitudinal
axis.

I converted all model based sceneries in the scenery folder to the new orientation,
and I hope that everything still looks allright. Joel, I think you will have to
make a change to your Brie scenery to adapt it to the new orientation:

old axis    new axis
   x          east
   y          north
   z          height

Pitch and roll are inverted. Heading is inverted and rotated by 180 degrees:

old heading   new heading
     0            180
    90             90
   180              0
   270            270

I think it's o.k. to implement these changes without increasing the scenery file
format version number. The format was never fully specified and documented,
so let's change the existing sceneries and stick with version 3.

During testing I noticed that loading an airplane as a static object in a scenery
will heavily increase CPU load. Even a simple model like the allegro made it
impossible to use CRRCsim on my netbook. The big number of triangles and the
fact that we make a full H.O.T. intersection test for each hardpoint leads
to extreme calculation efforts. Terrain tiling doesn't help here, because many
triangles will be focussed on one grid cell. I guess I'll implement a feature
that makes it possible to load transparent objects as collision boxes. Then a
complicated object can be excluded from H.O.T. calculations, and a transparent
box can provide approximated height values.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Hi Jens,

I think it's easier to understand for scenery makers to have a positive "height"
coordinate. And AFAIK the whole geo sciences usually provide data as
north/east/elevation with positive values for the latter. Just take a look at
the NMEA output of a GPS device.

I could add "down" as an alternative for the height attribute with
inverted meaning for those who are used to it.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

No, it doesn't matter to me. But what about calculations? Is there a need
for an extra minus in every transformation and the like because the
coordinate system is not right handed? Would it make sense to use
north/east/up on outside interfaces and north/east/down internally to
simplify the math?

Best regards (and, by the way: happy new year!),

Hi Jens,

the unified coordinate system only exists for the user interface (the XML
files). Internally, mod_video and mod_landscape (at least the graphics part)
use different coordinate systems, partly the "classic" OpenGL coordinates
(y is up, x/z is the horizontal plane), partly PLIB coordinates (z is up,
x/y is the horizontal plane). Conversions are done while parsing the XML
files or by adding a global transformation node near the root of the
scene graph. The internal interface between the FDM and mod_video is
using the FDM coordinate system. I think that's what really matters.

I tried to use x north y east z down in PLIB some time ago, but I ran into
problems, so I lived with the conversions.

Same to you!

Subject: [Crrcsim-devel] launch dialogue
Message-ID: <1263392830.4109.34.camel@joel-portable>

Hello, 
I noticed a lack of initialization of the parameters "rel_to_player ", "
rel_front" and "rel_right" in the launch dialogue. The correction was
easy but I preferred to finish their integration in the dialogue.

So, it is now possible to put "rel_to_player" in "0" to use the
"Starting position" of the scenery (At the moment, only the first one).
To show him, I added a position "beginning of runway" in the "simple
scenery".

It remains to add one widgets of choice of the start position  if there
are some in the scenery.

Note : It will be maybe useful to add a parameter "start direction" :
the wind is not still exactly in the axis the runway!

I guess we also need something like this in the scenery selection dialog.

Yes, we should implement something like this.

Is done !
the name of selected starting position is stored in crrcsim.xml in
current scenery section.

> I guess we also need something like this in the scenery selection dialog.

I do not think that it is necessary.
In the scenery selection dialog it will be necessary to add preview,
description...
It does not seem to me urgent as long as we have so few scenery.

I return to the fluid mechanics and to the finites elements for wind
simulation.

Comment:
These issues are not related to each other:
1.) The strange look of the rotor disc is indeed caused by changeset 91f79a2b02ab. The problem is that translucent polygons affect the z buffer (just like opaque polygons). This means that the rendering order is important: If a far polygon is rendered first, and then a near and translucent polygon is rendered in front of it, the far polygon will "shine through". The other way round, if the near polygon is rendered first, the far polygon will fail the z buffer test and will not be written to the color buffer.

The rendering order was changed in this changeset, so the airplane will now be rendered before the scenery. This means that if you look through the rotor disc, you will no longer see the scenery, but the sky (that was rendered before the airplane). The scenery will fail the z buffer test against the rotor disc.

But on the other hand, you can now see the airplane through scenery billboards (like the frequency board, the trees in davis and so on). I'll think about possible ways to fix this.

Here's some good reading on the problem, which also explains why PLIB doesn't do alpha sorting (what many people recommend as the ultimate fix for this problem): http://www.sjbaker.org/steve/omniv/alpha_sorting.html

2.) The disappearing indicator issue is not caused by 91f79a2b02ab, but was visible a long time before. I've already put it on my task list for the next release (see http://crrcsim.berlios.de/wiki/index.php?n=CRRCsim.TaskList), but didn't have the time to hunt down the bug yet.

I experienced this with qc01 at davis, which easily shows the rotor-disc thingy just like you described it.

I have never seen the 'disappearing indicator' before, and 91f79a2b02ab is clearly different to its parent (0c58872541e2) in this case. Please try it out.

Regarding CRRCSim's traditional sceneries, this changeset creates more problems than it does solve (flying behind the frequency board is not a problem in 0c58872541e2) , so I think it should be backout-ed for now.

Summary: Alpha problem in model-based sceneries

Details: In model-based sceneries, there's a problem with rendering fully translucent objects, e.g. billboards like the frequency board or the western trees in the Davis scenery. The plane disappears behind these objects, although their fully translucent parts should not be written to the z buffer (PLIB should take care of this by setting glAlphaFunc to a sensible value).
