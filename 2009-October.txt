Subject: [Crrcsim-devel] New transmitter interface
Message-ID: <20091020221535.c4a388f6.jan.reucker@web.de>

Hello,

I've just pushed a patch from Nikolay Borisovich Eremeyev to the repository.
It adds a new interface variant to CRRCsim, the CT6A interface. It's a
serial interface based on interface_serial. The patch includes documentation
on the serial protocol in the documentation/input_method/CT6A folder.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Subject: [Crrcsim-devel] Downthrust working now, behaviour of flexifly
Message-ID: <20091021180659.GA6250@knusper>

Hi Jan and others,

after recognizing that the downthrust implementation we have had was simply
wrong, I (hopefully) did it right now and adjusted the Flexifly accordingly.
It was the only model in main which used (and needs) siginficant downthrust.

Jan, it would be nice if you could try it out and comment on it and/or
adjust it.

I completely removed previous downthrust behaviour, as it did not have any
effect (no pitch up or down) anyway.

Best regards,
Jens

Hi Jens,

nice bugfix, the behaviour of the Flexifly feels even more realistic now.
Although I didn't fly the real one for quite some time now (especially
with the original motor, which was later changed to a CDROM brushless),
I think it comes very close to the original now.

I also tried to modify the P-51 by adding some downthrust. To overcome
the tendency to nose-up at WOT, I needed about 20 degrees of downthrust,
so I think you should definitely try to move the CoG a bit more to the
back. The downthrust simulation seems to work perfectly: when flying
low and slow at about 25% with 20 deg of downthrust, suddenly opening
the throttle to 100% will pull the nose right into the ground... so the
thrust vector seems to be simulated correctly now :-)

Kind regards,
Jan R.

I just noticed that the prop position I entered is wrong. It is more like 0.16m in
front of CG than 0.9m (which is what I entered). So the quite big downthrust
angle can be reduced, too.

This is why I fixed the downthrust thing, but I experienced the same. I need
to understand it a bit more to ease the process.

Hi,

now that we have a near-perfect model for the Flexifly (do you have an
adjusted XML file that contains the new prop position and downthrust values?),
maybe we could close the circle back to the "few models" thread. I still
have that "finish the Flexifly tutorial in the Wiki" task on my list of open
points. So maybe we can put everything together now to finish the last
page. I guess my input files weren't that bad, maybe I can compare them to
your automagically created files to spot any severe differences. Then
you could maybe describe how you (or your tool) runs AVL to get the desired
output. Which commands to execute, which constraints to set, and so on.
And then the final step, which value from AVL goes where in the XML file.

All the plans for user-friendly tools are nice and I'd really appreciate
if something like this would be available in the near future, but until then
it would be quite helpful for all of us if there was at least one example
describing the workflow for creating a model. From measuring stuff on your
own airplane to test-flying it in CRRCsim. No matter how many tools are
involved in between, as long as anybody willing to do it actually can do it.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

I did not and I question whether this makes sense -- because I think the
flexifly has its problem somewhere else.

Here's what was used for the P51:
  +--------------------------------------------------------
  | oper
  | d3 pm 0
  | a a 0
  | x
  | st
  | pz-p51-bl-crrcsim-input.st
  | c1
  | 
  | q
  +--------------------------------------------------------

d3 is a "second elevator" only used to trim (pm, pitching moment=0) the
model (I described that method in some other post long time ago). 

The key to not needing downthrust is to force alpha=0, "a a 0". This is what
I found out some days ago. Lift is adjusted via center of gravity and angle
of attack.

Also, in the case shown above:

The actual d-number depends on your AVL input file, so take care when
reading rudder/elevator/aileron derivatives.

Do you think there still is a problem? I think its behaviour is quite
realistic now with the additional downthrust. The original also has a
slight tendency to pitch up when gaining speed, but I think that's o.k.
considering the fact that it's not designed as a "neutral" aerobatics
plane.

Many thanks for putting all this stuff together. I'll see if I can reproduce
the results and then put it in the Wiki to finish the tutorial.

Kind regards,
