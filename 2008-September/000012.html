<PRE>Hello Jan and others,

&gt;<i> First of all, yaw input should be inverted. I guess most pilots have 
</I>&gt;<i> configured yaw to move the nose in the same direction as the stick,
</I>&gt;<i> although most beginners try to &quot;move the tail&quot;.
</I>Oh yes, this is currently wrong. However, the reason is not that I was
'moving the tail' but that I set up the transmitter interface from scratch
and didn't compare with test mode or some fixed wing plane. I simply mapped
and inverted until it was fine.

By the way, there is something wrong with transmitter interface setup. I
used a clean crrcsim.xml (I removed it), chose 'FMSPIC', and '/dev/ttyUSB0'
for the device, but then it crashed and still wanted to use '/dev/ttyS0'. So
I had to write FMSPIC.port.name into crrcsim.xml using an editor.

I noticed something else when fixing the yaw thing: throttle is inverse
(related to fixed wing model). The behaviour of the variable seems right,
but I feel 
 - throttle is positive for stick forward with fixed wing model
 - throttle is positive for stick backward with fixed pitch heli model
 - throttle (controls climb in this case) is positive for stick backward
   with collective pitch heli model

So the meaning of throttle has to be inverted when switching between fixed
wing/heli. For me this is ok, as I have to remap anyway. But maybe I should
invert throttle in the heli code to save user one click?

I prefer the following setup (please comment if this is totally strange and
what is strange about it):

fixed wing:
  left stick is elevator, rudder
  right stick is throttle, aileron

heli:
  Roll and pitch have to be on one stick, and I want them on the right stick.
  So there is throttle (collective pitch) and yaw on the left stick.
 
Something else: I searched the web for correct english words, but I am not
sure about them...

roll and yaw seem right, but what about 
  - pitch (rotation about model's y-axis). Is 'nick' the correct word, or
    is it just used in Germany?
  - What to use for collective pitch (controls climb)?

Well, some questions here...

When commenting on the heli's aero parameters, please keep in mind that the
current file includes three different settings! I think it would be fine if
we could adjust settings for differents types (I will fill them into the
file):

  - koaxial indoor
  - fixed pitch
  - collective pitch, beginner type
  - collective pitch, expert type

And everyone of them with an indoor setting (no wind) and with an outdoor
setting (disturbances because of medium wind).
    
Best regards,
Jens
