Yes, I'm currently working on this. The &quot;ctrlgen&quot; dialog showed some very
weird behaviour, so I &quot;fixed&quot; something, which unfortunately caused some
more weird behaviour... I decided to rewrite large parts of the dialog (and
actually split it into two dialogs), but this is not ready for the public,
yet. FMSPIC and ZhenHua device selection seems to be working now, but
joystick and AUDIO still need some work. I will push my changesets ASAP,
but it may still take about a week or so.
 
&gt;<i> I noticed something else when fixing the yaw thing: throttle is inverse
</I>&gt;<i> (related to fixed wing model). The behaviour of the variable seems right,
</I>&gt;<i> but I feel 
</I>&gt;<i>  - throttle is positive for stick forward with fixed wing model
</I>&gt;<i>  - throttle is positive for stick backward with fixed pitch heli model
</I>&gt;<i>  - throttle (controls climb in this case) is positive for stick backward
</I>&gt;<i>    with collective pitch heli model
</I>
I guess there's no &quot;right&quot; way to implement throttle behaviour. Some pilots
like the &quot;fixed-wing&quot; behaviour (forward == more power), others like
the &quot;real-thing&quot; behaviour (pull the stick for more power, like in a
real copter).

&gt;<i> So the meaning of throttle has to be inverted when switching between fixed
</I>&gt;<i> wing/heli. For me this is ok, as I have to remap anyway. But maybe I should
</I>&gt;<i> invert throttle in the heli code to save user one click?
</I>
I'd prefer the &quot;fixed-wing&quot; behaviour: same stick direction gives more power
on both fixed-wing and heli models.

&gt;<i> I prefer the following setup (please comment if this is totally strange and
</I>&gt;<i> what is strange about it):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> fixed wing:
</I>&gt;<i>   left stick is elevator, rudder
</I>&gt;<i>   right stick is throttle, aileron
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> heli:
</I>&gt;<i>   Roll and pitch have to be on one stick, and I want them on the right stick.
</I>&gt;<i>   So there is throttle (collective pitch) and yaw on the left stick.
</I>
I prefer the same heli setup, and I guess that's what most people are using,
maybe with left and right stick swapped. My fixed-wing setup is swapped,
so that the throttle stick is always on the left for both fixed-wing and heli.

Kind regards,
Jan R.
