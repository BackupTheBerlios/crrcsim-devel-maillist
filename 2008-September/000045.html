&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe we should even release 0.9.10 before waiting for these additions,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just to get a bigger audience. Or we should provide some kind of &quot;beta&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; packages.
</I>&gt;<i> We'll, at least for the heli part I'd like to have some 'confirmed'
</I>&gt;<i> sets of parameters.
</I>
O.k.

&gt;<i> Could you tweak the coax configuration so that it feels almost right?
</I>
I'll try. I flew the simulated coax for only a few minutes and noticed that
some parameters aren't right yet, but all in all it shouldn't be too hard.
But I think I need some test flights with my real coax before, it's been
sitting on the shelf for quite a time. Gotta persuade the kids that I
need their room for some extended test flying, it's too windy outside
right now.

&gt;<i> I hardly know helicopter pilots, but I'll do my very best in contacting
</I>&gt;<i> them. However, we might need a prerelease for windows...
</I>
No problem. Anytime.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; Tonight I'll try to implement retractable gear support. 
</I>&gt;<i> Another big step in terms of features! The next CRRCSim release is gonna be
</I>&gt;<i> really cool...
</I>
Right. Check out the latest tip, the Sport can now retract its gear. It's
only the plain animation because I had to read several tutorials on Blender
before I figured out how to do some minimal changes to the model and
didn't have more time to dive into the code, but it looks quite nice.

The fdm actually needs two additions. Hardpoints must be movable, and
there should be a parameter for additional drag caused by the plane.
Maybe there should even be a parameter for additional pitching moment.
Hopefully I can add all this during the next few days.
 
Kind regards,
Jan R.
