Hi Jens,

long time no see ;) Welcome back!

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm currently revisiting the hardpoint handling code, so maybe I can include
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this as well.
</I>&gt;<i> I thought about adding a parameter to every hard point which is the force
</I>&gt;<i> (no matter in which direction, just the length of the resulting vector) at
</I>&gt;<i> which the structure is damaged.
</I>
Ack. Thought about the same thing. But we have to think about the consequences:

- Simply freeze the simulation and force the user to reset.
- Stop calculating lift after damaging any hardpoint so that the plane will
  bounce on the ground and crash, also forcing the user to reset.
- Something else?

I guess it's time to integrate the EventDispatcher I proposed recently:

<A HREF="http://crrcsim.berlios.de/wiki/index.php?n=CRRCsim.EventDispatcher">http://crrcsim.berlios.de/wiki/index.php?n=CRRCsim.EventDispatcher</A>

This is a typical use case for this mechanism. If a wheel detects a crash,
it will throw an event. FDM and other interested objects (like, maybe, a
flight time stopwatch or the main statemachine) catch this event. When the
user resets the sim, a &quot;reset&quot; event is thrown, which in turn is caught by
every wheel, setting back the &quot;crashed&quot; state. This provides very loose
coupling between all participating objects.
 
A &quot;normal&quot; touchdown, of course, will also throw some kind of event received
by e.g. a flight time stopwatch.

&gt;<i> Furthermore, one might need to adjust 'sliding_mu' (see code) for every
</I>&gt;<i> non-gear hardpoint?
</I>
Yes, I guess that &quot;tyres on tarmac&quot; is not what you usually want for a glider.

I guess you've already noticed that I pushed some changes regarding wheel
handling. There are no functional changes yet, only structural changes. Maybe
you have a better idea for a more general interface between FDM and WheelSystem?
It worked fine for fdm_larcsim and fdm_heli, but not for fdm_002 (maybe the
adaption is easy, but I don't know enough about the code and the math behind
it).

About retracting hardpoints: I think it should be enough to define a destination
point and linearly interpolate between the original hardpoint location and the
destination, based on the current RETRACT input value. This introduces a certain
error for swinging gears, but even interpolating along a circle would lead to an
error (because the real contact point moves along the outline of the wheel while
retracting the gear). And it would be much harder to configure, if it is possible
in a flexible way at all.

Kind regards,
Jan R.
