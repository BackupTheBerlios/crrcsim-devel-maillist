Some more thoughts on &quot;loose coupling&quot;...

Maybe this is the wrong approach. I experimented with communicating the
animation setup to the Wheels via the EventDispatcher. Would work o.k. I
guess. But if you think some steps ahead, there's one major problem:
today we only have ONE fdm, ONE TSimInputs and ONE 3D model. So a Wheel
can always be sure that a &quot;NewAnimationConfigured&quot; event originated from
a graphical airplane representation that belonged to the same fdm as itself.

In future, it should be possible to load more than one airplane, e.g. for
network play, &quot;ghost&quot; playback or AI traffic. Therefore it would make
sense to couple these three components even tighter by stuffing one instance
of each into a &quot;master&quot; class that really holds everything that belongs to
a single airplane. That's what I originally designed CRRCAirplane for,
but it has become the &quot;multimedia&quot; representation of an airplane without
the physics stuff.

So what about a class that provides a &quot;master interface&quot; to everything that
is related to a single airplane? This master class can also provide the
necessary coupling between the parts of an airplane (so that an animation
from the CRRCAirplane part can call a method in the WheelSystem of the
FDM part), but in a way that all parts only have to know the parent class,
and the parent does not need to know details like PLIB data types or methods
(if you want to compile the FDM without graphics).

Then it should be fairly easy to add more airplane instances for different
purposes.

While I thought about this I noticed that there seems to be a memory leak
when loading a different model through the GUI:

CGUIPlaneSelCallback() deallocates Global::airplane, but not Global::fdm.
Then loadAirplane() creates a new fdm instance.

Kind regards,
Jan R.
