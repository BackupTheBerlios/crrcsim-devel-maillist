Hello Joel,

that's good news! I can't wait to try it out.

Are you using the existing skybox code or did you write a new class for this
purpose?

I think this is a good solution, and other simulators handle it in the same way.
This also makes it possible to place transparent primitives like cubes or
cylinders in the landscape to get a simple collision detection (if we want
to implement it some day).

Yes, ssgLOS hogs the CPU because it walks through every rendered triangle to
determine if it intersects with the given line of sight. You have to tile
the environment to profit from frustrum culling to reduce the number of
rendered triangles.

My solution for this problem (purely theoretical, didn't find the time to
try it out yet): Define an evenly spaced grid and call getLOS for each
grid point while loading the scenery. This generates a height map for the
given terrain. Then you can lookup the height by interpolating values from
this height map which should be precise enough and extremely fast compared
with ssgLOS.

Another possibility would be to reduce the number of hardpoints that actually
call ssgLOS. If we only call it for four "corner hardpoints" and interpolate
for all others, CPU usage should be reduced by about 60-90% depending on the
plane model.

Yes, let's work on this later. However, when generating a height map as
described above, I can provide some formulas from a simulation that I did
about a year ago and that seemed to calculate quite realistic vertical
winds. The interface should be something like

CRRCMath::Vector3 getWind(CRRCMath::Vector3& location)

Let's focus on flying, not crashing ;-)

There are already some parameters for the airplane in the "wheels" section
of the XML file that define bouncing (spring constant) and friction.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Hello with all!

I transferred on hg.berlios.de my modifications. It still remains me to work
but you can start to play. 

Merry Christmas!

Hello Joel,

nice work! Here are some unsorted comments:

- The panorama scenery looks good, especially with the more detailed texture set.

- The size of the textures in .rgb format is unbearable. The hg repository grew
  from 10 MB to about 90 MB (only counting the .hg directory itself), which means
  that a working copy now uses about 200 MB instead of 30 MB. So I think now is the
  time to write a jpg loader (based on libjpeg). I don't know if we can integrate it
  into PLIB-SSG without touching SSG itself, but we could at least use it to generate
  ssgStates for the sky box rendering.

- Even with a jpg loader, we should discuss how we store data files in the future.
  Maybe we should only keep a small set of data files in the main hg repository
  (the original sceneries plus about 5 good quality models) and move everything else
  to a different location. Data files don't change that much, and a VCS is not the
  ideal place to store binary files.

- Although my system isn't too bad (Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core 4200+, NVidia GeForce
  7300 GS, 1 GB RAM), I get stuttering with the panorama scenery. I don't know if
  this is a result of improper culling of the sky box (all faces are drawn, even
  the invisible faces, although SSG usually performs culling before rendering;
  I'll have to investigate why SSG fails here).
  I get up to 140 FPS, but the stuttering remains visible, so maybe it's a problem
  of a non-constant frame rate rather than low frame rate.

Kind regards,
Jan R.
