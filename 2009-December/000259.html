Hi Joel and others!

Maybe Google Earth can help here? At least for a very coarse grid (which
should be enough for the big distance calculations) you can directly
enter the N/E coordinates and then read out the height value. I don't know
if there's a free API to access these values without using GE as a
frontend. I guess most parts of the GE API are only for premium users.

I agree. And I'd really like to continue to run CRRCsim on my netbook with
only 512 MB of RAM in the future ;-) (without having to rip it apart to add
another 512 MBs).

Maybe we should lower our standards regarding wind component precision. Do
we really need floating point precision? And which values do we need apart
from x/y/z components of the wind vector at this point. Let's see: typical
flying conditions are somewhere between 0 and 10 bft., which equals 0 to
about 25 m/s. If we use one byte per component, we get a resolution of about
0.1 m/s per bit. I guess that should be enough, considering the fact that
we always use interpolated values with a much finer resolution. And I really
think that 2m should be enough as long as we don't want to simulate every
little bit of turbulence behind the outhouse. ;-)

12.500.000 cells * 3 byte = 36.6 MByte

And maybe we can make this configurable, using a wider grid on low-power
machines.

Kind regards,
Jan R.
