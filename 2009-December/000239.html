<PRE>Bug #16505, was updated on 2009-Dec-01 04:57
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: CRRCsim
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 9
Submitted by: wheeldweller
Assigned to : jreucker
Summary: Spolier/Flaps non-functional

Details: It's probably the only thing 'advertised' that doesn't work: spoilers and flaps.

My joystick is being sensed properly- axis 3 can be used to operate the throttle, for instance. It's a lot of fun, too!

And I've tried just about every high-dollar glider, especially the high-aspect ratio types, and changing the spoiler setting never shows up, and it never changes the flight characteristics, either. Inverted or normal, no change at all.

In Huntsville, Alabama we had a gusty, windy day. I pointed it into the wind, facing me, and popped the spoilers of my Aquila to make it land at my feet.  People having trouble that day actually cheered. I'd know if they were working.  :)

If they aren't coded, let's just get rid of the labels and such. Exactly as it stands it's a spectacular program and I enjoy it very, very much.  It'd just be nice if the spoilers/flaps worked, so I could land it more easily.

Thanks

Hello,

thanks for your bug report. However, I have to mark it as invalid. Spoilers and flaps are modelled in CRRCsim (since version 0.9.10). But right now there's AFAIK only one model that provides spoiler and flap settings: the Scorpion.

If you are interested in adding working spoilers and/or flaps to one of the other gliders, please read documentation/file_format/index.html in the CRRCsim folder and take a look at models/Scorpion.xml to see how it is done. Feel free to submit a patch or at least the parameters if you created something that &quot;feels just right&quot;.

Kind regards,
Jan R.
