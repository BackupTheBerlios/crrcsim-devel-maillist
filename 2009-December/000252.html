Maybe I'll even create more files for the various sub-classes. It makes things
much easier to browse and find. But I've started to do some clean-ups in
the landscape module anyway, so I'll see later what goes where.

Tasks that I plan to accomplish in the near future:
- Write up some documentation on the existing scenery file format (similar to
  the existing documentation in the file_format folder).
- Maybe do some harmonisation between the existing file formats (e.g. use the
  same coordinate system for scenery and FDM, support metric units in scenery
  files using the &quot;units&quot; attribute). This may lead to a version &quot;4&quot; of the
  scenery description format.
- Refactor the existing height calculation mechanism into its own hierarchy
  of classes to build a generic interface for the FDM and windfield algorithms.
  This should make it easier to select between different height calculation
  mechanisms (like what you started with the getHeight_mode attribute) and,
  later on, different windfield implementations.
 
&gt;<i> But It would be necessary to manage better the collisions. A complete
</I>&gt;<i> management is a big work. In the meantime, I propose you the addition of
</I>&gt;<i> some line in the file &quot;mod_fdm/gear01/gear.cpp&quot;. It is very imperfect.

</I>
What about the following approach:

- The existing code already calculates the force that acts on each hardpoint.
- We could extend the hardpoint description with a new attribute &quot;max_force&quot;.
- After calculating the force for a hardpoint, we compare it to the max_force
  and emit a CRASH_EVENT or something like this if the maximum is exceeded.
- The SimStateHandler is extended to catch this event and go to a CRASHED state
  that can only be left by a simulation reset command.
- If max_force is not defined for a hardpoint, we do nothing.

All this should be easy to implement. The hardest part is finding appropriate
empirical values for the max_force. But the biggest advantage is that we get
different behaviour for different hardpoints: you can set the max_force for a
propeller to a very low value, while the gear itself can take much more load
without breaking. 

Of course, your code is &quot;better than nothing&quot; compared to the current state with
the unrealistic &quot;frisbee&quot; collisions, but I think it's easy to &quot;make it right&quot;
here.

Kind regards,
Jan R.
