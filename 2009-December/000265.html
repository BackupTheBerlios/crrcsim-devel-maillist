Still here. A bit. (I have other things on my todo list as well...)

My opinion is that &quot;quick and dirty&quot; is preferable for crrcsim. Look
at how enjoyable it already is to fly a plane with crrcsim without the
crash-detection.

Anyway, I think that a &quot;rough&quot; crash-detection is good. Even if it
sometimes would detect a crash when in real life it wouldn't really
damage the plane.

Anyway, I was personally thinking about a crash-o-meter. Visually the
same as the battery meter. 

Crash damage is additive. So if you &quot;hit&quot; below indicated
max-allowable force, no damage is done. If you hit between 1x and 2x
max allowable force, the plane is damaged, but in real life
repairable, in crrcsim flyable. Above 2x max force, the damage is
considered irrepairable and the plane becomes unflyable in crrcsim.

The damage meter would be green for the bottom third, yellow for the
middle third, and red for the top third.

So if you hit at .75x max force, the damage-meter would show green to
75% of the first third. This would &quot;bleed off&quot; slowly to allow people
to see how close they were to the yellow part.

If you hit at 1.25x max force, the damage meter would show yellow to 
.25 along the yellow part (5/12th of the total). 

Next if you hit at 1.50x max force, you'd still be allowed to fly, but
the damage meter would go up to .75 of the yellow part. Another hit of
more than 1.25x max force would now damage the plane enough to stop
being flyable in crrcsim.

We could make a damaged-but-flyable plane more fragile by reducing all
max-forces proportionally. :-)

	Roger.

Q: It doesn't work. A: Look buddy, doesn't work is an ambiguous statement. 
Does it sit on the couch all day? Is it unemployed? Please be specific!
