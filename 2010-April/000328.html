<PRE>&gt;<i> Jens, I noticed that there are still two extra heads in the repo. Is there any
</I>&gt;<i> way to get rid of them or do you want to keep them?
</I>I usually don't think open heads to be something one should get rid off --
as long as their number is small and they are there for a reason. Sometimes
my intention is to document a certain test on the changeset in question
without adding those code fragments and test results to the main branch,
because I don't feel that these are of general interest.

Do you understand what I want to achieve? Keeping some artifacts of work
in their context without polluting the dev/main branch.

I just looked at those changesets and recognized that there is something
wrong...most probably I transplanted those changesets (because I had some
tests and intermediate changesets) and transplanted one of them onto the
wrong ancestor:
  (2418b3f8c852) timing error of old code:
should be a child of
  (07660bd24f61) I forgot to add this file...to much clutter (not handled by
                 hgignore)

Despite this flaw, do you have a suggestion about how to save artifacts like
these in a way you like more?

With some effort (involving berlios and everyone being able to push to the
repo) we could rearrange those heads, otherwise we could use dummy merges
or some other append-only-operation.

Best regards,
Jens
