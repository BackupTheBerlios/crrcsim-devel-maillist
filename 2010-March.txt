Subject: [Crrcsim-devel] Create a flight model for an integral incidence
	glider
Message-ID: <1618447.8763.1268253829134.JavaMail.www@wwinf1f10>

Hello,
I try to create a flight model for a Crobe?
http://lecrobe.free.fr/main.htm . It is a micro glider which is
controlled by moving its whole wings (integral incidence) and using a
delta-mix on the remote control.

Thanks CRRCSim wiki, I run calculation with AVL. But I create ailerons
on wings, and elevator on the V-Tail. It works on CRRCSim. (Files
avalaible here : http://haju68.comoj.com/S-CRRCSim-Modeles.html )
Whereas, it is not totally realistic.

My question is : can we develop a model for integral incidence in AVL
and CRRCSim? Maybe by considering the whole wing as an elevon like on fying wings?
If yes, how can I do that?

Thanks a lot for answering me.

Julien

Subject: [Crrcsim-devel] Record and playback
Message-ID: <20100314184206.GA21157@knusper>

Hi,

I want to use CRRCSim to display movements I recorded on a real plane, so I
needed a way to make it read time/position/attitude from a file and use
those data.

However, I thought about more general use and implemented a FlightRecorder
with extended capability.

There is a new feature branch in the official repository --
changes/additions are small and easy to understand. There is no GUI yet,
because I think important features are missing: 

 - shadow mode, especially useful for F3F and training like this; as I know
   from posts and a screenshot, the early F3F branch had something like this
 - storing additional data like airplane, scenery, settings, ...
 - retrieving this data (only displaying it? Enforcing settings?)
 - showing F3F results from the recorded file (they are already stored)

I am not sure about how to implement this second ("shadow") plane yet --
comments are welcome regarding this task (and of course regarding the whole
thing...).

In case you want to try it out: recording are done automatically. If you
want to play one back, add some playback line to the simulation section
in your crrcsim.xml. It might look like this afterwards:

  <simulation>
    <flightModel dt="0.002777" />
    <display_mode fUse="0" />
    <playback mode="demo" file="record.log" />
  </simulation>

Have fun,
Jens

This post is just me writing while I'm thinking about it...

Aircraft(src/aircraft.cpp) loads 3D model and FDM, it is directly called
from crrc_main.cpp's "void loadAirplane()". 

There could be a second instance of Aircraft (for shadow mode).
Aircraft::load() could be told about shadow mode by giving a non-empty file
name for a recorded flight; in this case 
 - Aircraft would load the fdm before loading the 3D model
 - CRRC_AirplaneSim_Playback could expose XML data from the recorded file's 
   header 
 - now Aircraft can load the 3D model, as the filename is known
 
This could be repeated for any number of "shadow planes" by letting the user
open many recorded files. We could go further: the recorded file can be
identified by its header (well, not yet, but this is easy and already prepared
for) and may not even be a recorded file. It could contain settings for
an FDM which is a "robot player" or gets its data from the network.
CRRCSim could export data of its manually controlled airplane to a server or
another client, while displaying another airplane after loading its network
settings from a file.

While loading a file, the user should be able to select whether this file
replaces the manually controlled airplane or whether it is a "shadow plane".
It must also be possible to remove one of the existing "Aircraft"s.

But this is sligthly more than I'm planning to do; it is just thinking
whether it can be extended and how it could work.

Best regards,
Jens

Good idea (as usual...)! It's something really useful, and I guess you know the related
feature requests.

Getting an additional model (at least its visual representation) is easy,
it's allready prepared in mod_video. Just use Video::new_visualization() to
load the graphics, Video::set_position() to update its position and and
Video::delete_visualization() when you're done. But I guess you already know
that and are more likely thinking about the general design changes and extensions
needed to manage more than one plane... A good design decision here would
make adding things like multiplayer a breeze; I guess it wouldn't matter
if the data controlling the plane came from a network interface instead
from a file.

To provide any more concrete ideas, I'd need to look at your changes. The
last few weeks were pretty busy, so I had no time for CRRCsim (although I
promised to think about a clean interface for the wind simulation code).
I hope that this changes after the next week. 
 
Kind regards,
Jan R.

I did not know -- but I knew that graphics and related is out of my scope,
as well as general design is not only up to me, so I'm thinking out loud ;-)

This is what I posted some ten minutes ago, too.

I'll keep posting my thoughts and committing changesets once I feel the code
is not plain silly. It'll remain in the feature branch until it is finished
and accepted, though.

Thanks a lot for your fast reply,

Hi Jens,
You got a nice idea to reintroduce  again this "shadow" mode. It is very 
useful for training F3F to "fight" against your shadow, which may have 
been  recorded as your best run.
As far as i remember, it took little cpu processing to record, so as you 
suggest, doing a "continuous recording" might be possible.
When I used it for training, usually I just recorded my best run, and 
then shadow it and flight against it to improve and see where I could 
save some time.
One way to see it;
     - save the run manually (or the last X seconds) in a file,
     - at any time recall a file as shadow

In original F3F version, the shadow started simultaneously when the 
model enter the course. This allow a direct comparison between your 
current flight and the shadow, against time.

It is working like this since yesterday.

I planned something more, already written down in the docs: both planes
start simultaneously; shadow plane will be stopped at the start position if
it is there before the player or 'beamed' if it is not there yet. To enable
this, special marks are inserted into the record. 
Well, lots of nice additional features are possible.

Hello Jens,

It seems to me that the only problem of binary data portability is the
bytes order convention : "little indian" or "big indian".
There is also the format of floating numbers representation but the
normalized format IEEE 754 is used everywhere.
One simple and sure solution  is to write in binary a word of value
agreed in a header to know if the convention used in the file is the
same that that used by the machine host. If it is different, it is
necessary to swap the bytes of every word after reading.
The difficulty will be to test it: I believe that we have all Intel
processors  or compatible(Little Endian). Apple used PowerPC ( Big
Indian) but it seems to me that now it uses Intel.

That means the only issue with floats/doubles is byte order, too? Good news.
I searched the net but only found the usual integer examples and a paper
dealing with ancient unix systems.

I will not go that way. The files will use native x86 byte order (little
endian), other systems will have to byteswap.

Well, that's good and bad. Good, because we usually don't have to care about
byte order, but bad because we'll be surprised once the first big-endian
machine runs CRRCSim ;-)

Anyway, I'll prepare the code for endianess issues...

Thanks,
Jens

Speaking for modern x86(_64) platforms you should be right, but I'm currently
developing software for a platform with a non-IEEE754 float format. The bit
arrangement differs from the usual sign/exponent/fraction layout. But I
guess that shouldn't bother you regarding CRRCsim.

> I will not go that way. The files will use native x86 byte order (little

I would do it the same way. There's no need to bother with a flexible file
format as long as you are in control of the format definition.

Good idea.

PLIB is a nice library, and CRRCsim definitely benefits from it. PLIB is very
mature and has few bugs, nice. But there's only a very small chance of ever
seeing any really new features in it. So if we want things like a more
sophisticated GUI or better 3D rendering with real shadows or vertex shaders,
we have to switch to something else. Therefore I don't want to use PLIB
features if I can avoid them, especially for modules that are not related to
the GUI or 3D rendering.

Regarding SG: It's a very complete library with lots of functions that are
really useful for games. But I don't like the general design (treating
vectors and matrices as plain arrays and handling them in unrelated functions).
Therefore I prefer using CRRCMath if possible, extending the existing classes
if needed. It has a much more object-oriented design which leads to "nicer"
code.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Hi Jens,

I didn't review the code in full detail, but I had great fun racing against my
own shadow... so I think it should definitely be merged into the default
branch.

My design intention was not to use AirplaneVisualization outside of the Video
namespace. The whole mod_video should be accessible through a non-class
interface which would make it easier to separate it into a DLL or whatever.
Therefore I created the non-class functions new_visualization(),
delete_visualization() and set_position() to handle the visualization instances.
This should be sufficient to manage additional models. Maybe you could try
to use this interface instead of accessing AirplaneVisualization directly?

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Bravo to Jens to work on this very useful feature!

I did not look at the code but I played as an end user.
The recording works well and does not hamper the piloting. On the other
hand, playback must be still enhanced reliability. Here are several
remarks, of uneven importance.

Jo?l


*I had several errors:

- after several "Restart" in mode playback of "record000.crrclog" :
"terminate called after throwing an instance of 'XMLException'"

-And then :
"Not CRRC_AirplaneSim_Playback: stream: XML-Element wurde nicht
abgeschlossen: 
Erreur de segmentation"

-In the dialogue " Load robots ", if we click "OK" without having
selected of file:
"The file could not be loaded by any FDM.
They said:
  Not CRRC_AirplaneSim_Playback: error opening infile
Erreur de segmentation"

*If we replay a flight in "shadow" mode, we obtain two shadows. Is it
wanted?

*If we replay a flight in mode "demo, replacing to use" the command
"Remove all robots" is ineffective.

*At the end of a "replay", the "shadow" congeals in the position of the
last image. It is not very elegant if it was still in flight.

*It is not easy to know how to choose what of the automatic recordings
is the most recent. (Is it really useful to have any of it?)

*The name "robot" is not (in my opinion ) easy to understand. It seems
to me that "Flight recorder" would be better.

*Is it necessary to create a specific menu? It could be in
"Simulation".

Of coures I'll do so and revert my changes to AirplaneVisualization -- I
don't want to interfere with your API thoughts.

However, I don't know how to do it. new_visualization(), like the others, is
not 'static', but 'friend'. What does that mean? I'd expect a static
function. 'static' alone doesn't work because the list is private. 'static
friend' is not possible. So I declare the list to be public. Then I stumble
over new_visualization() being a class member in airplane_vis.h, but not in
airplane_vis.cpp. You want it to be a non-class interface, so I move them
out of the class declaration. This can be compiled.

I wonder why it works with unpatched code for crrc_loadair.cpp? In case I do
it like crrc_loadair.cpp, the compiler tells me

I had been both in a hurry and worked too much last week, so every changeset
before 
            51ea41dfaf88   2010-03-20 12:15 +0100
            another regression fix...
has been more or less buggy.
Can you make sure your comments (the one I do not reply to below) are not
related to earlier versions?

This was an error with the current version, too. Fixed in f71a10c1c4cf,
pushed just now.

> wanted?
I don't know what you try to say. 
It is possible and wanted to have more than robot, and it is possible and
wanted to have robots in demo mode.
Could you please explain in other words/more detail?

> *If we replay a flight in mode "demo, replacing to use" the command
> "Remove all robots" is ineffective.
Yes, indeed. You have to load an airplane to regain user input. It would be
possible to change this, but robot and demo are different things, so I
wouldn't want to mix them here...

> *At the end of a "replay", the "shadow" congeals in the position of the

Yes, that's right. I don't plan to change this. Changing it would mean that
some new things have to be introduced: src/robots.cpp needs to know when a
flight log has ended in order to remove the visualization, just to recreate
it on reset. That's a lot of complexity for a small enhancement, I think.

> *It is not easy to know how to choose what of the automatic recordings
> is the most recent. (Is it really useful to have any of it?)
Well...if you forgot to give a useful name before ending a flight, you can
still quit crrcsim, rename files and thereby save your log. This is why I
wanted to have more than just the current flight log.

> *The name "robot" is not (in my opinion ) easy to understand. It seems
> to me that "Flight recorder" would be better.

It is not necessary to use a new menu, but I thought it's easier to
understand. I did not use something like "load flight log" and "remove all
shadow planes" because the current menus and code can be used unchanged for
something like a remote player or any other plane not controlled by the
primary user. Once we have something like this, we'd need to go back to
something similar like the current state.
I understand that this abstract view of things is not easy as long as there
is just flight log/shadow plane...

Thanks for your comments,
Jens

Hi Jens,

please don't include any of the headers from *inside* mod_video, just use the
external interface header src/global_video.h. This header declares the three
functions in the correct way. The AirplaneVisualization declares these functions
as friends to grant them access to the private static list of visualizations.
I think this allows for strict encapsulation without needing a whole bunch of
proxy functions to manipulate the list from outside the class.

Please try if this helps. Otherwise I'll take a look at the changesets you sent
me, but I won't be able to do this before late this evening.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Thanks for the clarification, this was the missing link. I didn't take a
look at src/global_video.h. 
The new changeset is available at berlios.

I see -- you used one of the recordXXXX.crrclog files to playback as a
shadow? Actually, this will fail, yes. 

Maybe it would be better to hide those automatic files from the user, so he
won't get confused by files he has not created/saved. So saving previous
runs might be for power users.

Yes, would be possible, but means additional work/complexity. I'd rather add
a helpful comment to the load dialog.

It is not before, you are right. One wants to save a flight as soon as one
recognizes that a flight is worth saving -- which will surely happen
during this flight. This is how it works now: once you recognize it is worth
saving, you give it a name and a comment (both of which can be changed as
long as the flight is not over yet) and just go on. You don't have to
remember to save it when it's over.

Indeed, seems you didn't understand how it works.

I disagree. When I start working on a file, I'll save it for the first time
WHILE working on it. Your proposal is like working on file A, closing file A
without saving, start working on file B, and then giving a name to file A.
I'm glad computer programs don't work like this. 

> We could add an option to choose one of the last ones.
I agree that a 'hey, me stupid idiot forgot to save the last flight, can I
do it now?' - command might make sense. But this is only for people who are
overly oblivious.

Well, no. I'll rather hide them.

I just pushed two changesets: hiding automatic record files and more verbose
GUI.
