Message-ID: <201105061712.p46HCwg4006997@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #18100, was updated on 2011-May-06 13:12

Summary: Geodetic latitude calculation has numerical instability

Details: The conversion from geocentric to geodetic latitude in the function ls_geoc_to_geod(...) in ls_geodesy.cpp suffers from numerical instability around zero latitude, making the simulation jerky as the aircraft crosses the "equator" because the geodetic latitude output becomes coarse.

I will be uploading a patch to fix this, it implements a fast version of Bowring's iterative formula for calculating geodetic location. This function does not suffer from instability around the equator and behaves just like the old function everywhere else.

Thanks for your bug report and your patch. I'm no expert for CRRCsim's internal FDM implementation and its coordinate systems, so it's hard for me to evaluate the patch. Can you provide a simple test case so that I can see where your patch helps? E.g. some directions like "fly across coordinates xyz and you'll see stuttering, apply the patch and try again"?

Comment:
This is easiest to see with the helicopter or quadrotor because you can fly across the y axis slowly. Choose the launch site to be close to (0, 0), and fly around slowly, you should see the simulation stutter. I added a line to the debug display showing x,y,z coordinates to make it easier for me to track down the problem. If you do this, then watch the x coordinate as you drift slowly across the y axis, when it hits zero you will see stuttering. This attached picture shows a plot of the geocentric and geodetic latitudes before the patch, you can clearly see the problem around x = 0. After the patch, the geodetic latitude follows the geocentric smoothly.
