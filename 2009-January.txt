Subject: [Crrcsim-devel] Multiple crrcsim.xml files?
Message-ID: <BCAD03E3113C4755B0C9C9871B88D811@Q9450>

I was just wondering about a way to keep multiple crrcsim.xml files or a way
to manage setups.

For example if I want to play the F3F game and I get everything setup the
way I want it.  And then I decide that I want to do Thermal at the Davis
Field with a different airplane.

I guess that I could manually copy my crrcsim.xml file to f3f.xml.
And then rename the files for what I want each time a want to do a different
type of flying.

I think it would be nice if CRRCSim would let me manage the different
setups.

What do you think?

Thanks!
Jerry Williams

This can already be achieved on the command line:

crrcsim -g config.xml

will use config.xml as the active configuration. So you can easily create multiple
start menu entries or desktop links that use different config files, just by
editing the link's command line.

Kind regards,

Thanks!

I have been running a version crrcsim 0.9.10-alpha2-c92ef3cb697e on
Windows Vista 64-bit.
Would you happen to have a newer version that I could install for windows?
This version seems to die sometimes when I make changes, but I like the new
features, so I am spoiled and don't want to go back to 0.9.9.  :)

I thought about building it, but not sure the compiler will run on my
machine.

Thanks again,
Jerry Williams

Hi Jerry,

sorry, this is currently the latest version available for Windows. I'll see
if I can compile and pack a version that contains the new "Brie" scenery,
but expect it to be a huge download compared to the current version.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Hello,

 

I finished the large part of the work of implementation in CRRCSIM.

 

The importation of the components of wind functions. I have currently only
values in 2 dimensions but all is envisaged in 3 dimensions.

It is enough to provide a file with values of coordinates (X, Y, Z) of the
components of wind vx, vy, vz. These values are interpolated linearly.

 

I also made the importation of textures in JPEG. Plib-Ssg makes it possible
to add functions to ssgLoadTexture by ssgAddTextureFormat.

 

 Some difficulties:

 

 - The importation of the wind is a little slow. The current file is
unnecessarily large but in 3D it will be necessarily large. This slowness
does not seem to me really awkward but it would be useful to post a window
of waiting during the loading of scene. 

 

- The components of wind are standardized values. They are multiplied by the
speed of the wind which the user can change. On the other hand, the
direction is fixed. The adjustment of the direction of the wind is thus
ineffective. It would thus be necessary to provide to invalidate this
adjustment or to replace it by the choice of discrete values (This problem
already exists for Cape_Cod) Idea? 

 

- I added the use of two new libraries: 

    * libjpeg (http://www.ijg.org/) for reading JPEG

    * CGAL (http://www.cgal.org/) for 3D triangulation of wind data.

It will thus be necessary to update the procedure of compilation. Jan ?

 

I pushed source and data file on Berlios. It will be well to remove the
large files xxx.rgb en scnery/Brie. Jens ?

 

Jo?l

This is no good news after being offline for about eight weeks...but I'm
back (some weeks of hard work and having no internet connection because of
me moving, four weeks being on holiday) and got telephone and internet
access just today. However, I won't have as much time to spend on CRRCSim as
before anytime soon.

Some thoughts and facts:
 - every single dev should talk to other devs BEFORE adding big files to the
   official repository. 
   The recent additions made the whole history of CRRCSim (including every
   revision of every single file) grow from 12MB to about 100MB by adding
   twelve files which sum up to more than 100MB (yes, the whole repo is
   smaller than one revision of just those files because it is compressed).
   'hg' even issues a warning if one adds files as big as in this case, but
   apparently it has been ignored.
 - Even the addition of the 'unnecessarily large' wind data seems odd to me.
   This data is used for a method which is not 'state of the art' (fixed
   direction of wind) although another dev (Jan) already announced that he
   has/has played with a method which might be used to calculate the windfield
   of any terrain/wind direction.
   So why pollute the official repo with such big and intermediate data?
 - intermediate/highly experimental code versions should not be pushed to the
   official repo. It is possible to make them available in some other way.
 - it is hard(...impossible) to strip history from distributed repositories,
   as they are distributed and one person is only able to strip his own
   repos, but not those of other people -- so when they push back to the
   official repo, the bad history may be back again
 - rewriting history has unwanted side effects (lots of work, at least)
 - Luckily not that much has happened and there is a little number of devs,
   so one/I can create a line of development in the repo which does not include
   the big files. But: 
     1. without help of the berlios staff it is not possible
        to strip the obsolete and big parts of the history. So we have to
        live with big repos for some time and hope that noone will ever push
        the unwanted history back to the official repo again
     2. every dev who has pulled this obsolete history is requested (and
        cannot be forced) to strip it from his own repo before pushing to 
        the official repo        

So lets see what I can do...

hg co 33569991f606
hg debugsetparents b5d92059e2b0

...

well, no, I've got better things to do.

Jo?l, please do a 
  hg co b5d92059e2b0
and replay your changes (without the big files, please do think about the
windfield thing, too), then push to the official repo again. It will have
one more head then. 
Contact berlios staff and request them to do a 
  hg strip 33569991f606
on our official repository to delete the unwanted line of development.

not amused,
Jens

Hi,

this is an important request which everyone who pulled from the official
repository since 19.12.2008 (and who plans to push back to it) must follow
in order to keep our (or his) repository small and clean:


1. Hopefully you have not based any changeset on the changesets 33569991f606
   or later. If this is the case, you must rebase them on b5d92059e2b0.

2. Enable the mq extension for your installation of mercurial. In your
   ~/.hgrc (or equivalent file on windows) there must be a line
  +--------------------------------------------------------
  | hgext.mq =
  +--------------------------------------------------------
   in the section '[extensions]'.

3. Issue 'hg strip 33569991f606' on every single one of your CRRCSim
   repositories, which will delete changeset 33569991f606 and what's derived
   from it.

Thanks,
Jens

Hi,

I guess this request to the berlios staff has to come from one of the
project admins. I'll take care of this. Do I have to wait until Joel
created the new head, or can I issue the request anytime? Maybe it would
be better to wait until the BerliOS staff fixed this issue before
pushing Joel's changes again.

One more thing that I'd like to discuss before fixing re-pushing the
changes: is CGAL really necessary for some windfield interpolation?
I'd like to keep the dependencies of CRRCsim small. I've put some
effort into removing the dependencies to GLUT to get rid of a library,
so I'd really appreciate if everybody thinks carefully about the
addition of new libraries. For me as a Linux user, it's usually easy
to fulfill library dependencies, but on Windows it's usually a lot
more work to download, compile and install extra dependencies.
So if we only need a small amount of code from a huge lib, we should
rather consider copying the code (if the license of the library
permits this!!!) instead of adding new dependencies.

But to judge this, I'd have to take a detailed look at Joel's
additions first. Didn't have the time to do it yet.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

The only thing which is important: noone should push the old code again
after it has been deleted on berlios. Whether we do it before or after Joel
has pushed his modified changes might not matter, as long as HE has a backup
of his things. 
So he should strip his personal repo after he did his modified changes.

Firstly, I present to you my excuse for my awkwardness. I had not understood
that the transfer of large data files increased in an irreversible way the
size of the history of Mercurial. Thank you in Jens to have proposed a
solution.

I transferred my modifications again. Without any large data file. I put
them on a personal site while waiting for a better solution. (See
scenery/Brie/ReadMe.txt)

Some comments on the solution chosen for the wind, in answer to the
questions of Jan and Jens:

- The quality of CRRCSIM is the realism of the fly. That is obtained by the
use of external software of simulation (AVL). I aim to preserve this realism
for the sites of slope soaring by the use of software of aerodynamic
simulation of the slope. (http://jugiraud1.free.fr/brie.htm).

- The problem is that the result of this simulation cannot be summarized by
only some coefficients. It is necessary to cover the space of flight by data
in 3 dimensions. To reduce the volume of these data, they are taken on a no
uniform grid. But that complicates the retrieval the data close to a point
of space. I noted that the interpolation is essential. To make this
interpolation of no regular data, a good technique is to carry out a
triangulation. The interpolation in a specified point then consists to seek
the triangle containing this point and to interpolate the values of the tops
linearly. (In 3D, the triangles become tetrahedrons.)

- I thought of calculating the triangulation at the outside of CRRCSIM but
that increases much the volume of the data file. I then found this library
CGAL which makes very well the triangulation and the search for tetrahedron.
The interface of the functions used is very simple (windata3D.cpp). It thus
seems preferable to me to use this library rather than to "reinvent the
wheel".
I did not have any difficulty to install it under Windows and Msys (.
/config; make).

- To recopy only the useful parts? I can test but I fear that is not easy
for CGAL. That is probably easier for libJPEG.

- Note, I envisaged to be able to compile CRRCSIM without importation of the
data of wind and thus without CGAL (see windata3D.h).


Cordially,

Jo?l

Hello to the CRRCsim developers, Jan Kansky may have already told you
that I have been in contact with him already if not I shall start from
the top. My name is Chris and I am an Ubuntu developer in training who
has accepted the task of packaging your application for usage in the
Ubuntu repositories which will later be ported over to the Debian ones.
There is however a minor problem with the source tarball of your
application regarding the packaging process. Both the Ubuntu & Debian
archives are very strict on maintaining copyrights to the respectful
owners, that is where the issue comes into place with this project.
Unfortunately their policy requires that each individual source-code
file, .cpp, .h & even .xml in the project has a header containing the
copyright holder of the file and the license of it, note that a single
file can have many copyright holders and multiple different files can
have different licenses all within the same project.

Ideally for the project to be included, what we are looking for is to
have a licence header, just like the source-codes under /chardevice.
This will enable us to get around the legalities of including your
software in our mirrors. Here is a copy of what we, the Ubuntu/Debian
packagers are meant to write in each package as an example (note that
this one was written by my Ubuntu developer mentor):
http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/k/kde-style-domino/current/copyright

As you can see, there are two licenses, the GPLv2 and the GPLv3 in that
project as well as having multiple copyright owners over multiple
directories. If possible could you release a new upstream tarball with
the respected copyright clearly shown in each source-file. If you have
any questions at all, please feel free to email me back directly or
through this mailing list.

Thanks for your time for reading this,
Chris.

Hi Chris,

welcome to the CRRCsim community! Being an Ubuntu (and former Debian) user
myself, I really appreciate your plans to debianize CRRCsim.

Most files in CRRCsim are released under the GPL v2, I guess that
mod_chardevice is the only exception. It's no problem to add license
headers to those files who are missing a proper header.

What's the minimum content of this header? Is it sufficient to name
the original author of the file and that the file is licensed under
GNU GPLv2? Here's a proposal:

/** 
 *  CRRCsim, the Charles River Radio Control Club Flight Simulator Project
 *
 *  \file crrc_system.cpp
 *
 *  This file contains some platform-specific stuff for
 *  system interaction.
 *
 *  Copyright:
 *    (C) 2005 Jan Reucker <slowhand_47 at gmx.de>
 *
 *  This file is licensed under the GNU GPLv2. You should have received a
 *  copy of this license with this source package (file COPYING).
 */

What do you think?

Kind regards,
Jan R.

No problem. It's one of the major features of DVCS systems compared to
classical VCS systems that you always have the whole repo history
side-by-side with your local working copy. But this puts a lot of
responsibility on the shoulders of each developer.

You're right, CRRCsim is all about realism. Therefore it's o.k. to have
the option to include realistic wind data. But I think it's quite
impractical to generate this wind data for each scenery and for each
wind direction. We should think about a way to integrate different
wind calculation methods and configure it through the scenery files.

O.k., if the data is not evenly distributed, I agree that interpolation is
a lot more complicated than with data distributed on a 2D/3D grid.

On my Ubuntu system, installing libcgal2 pulled in the following dependencies,
summing up to 274 MB of hard disc space.

I guess we should find a way to make libcgal optional. And we need to
integrate it in the automake process. Right now, ./configure does not
search for libcgal and therefore doesn't do its job, because if
libcgal is not installed, the CRRCsim build fails although ./configure
did not report any errors.

Then this #define has to be in crrc_config.h, and must be determined
by ./configure. I'll see what I can do.

And libjpeg should also be detected by ./configure....

Jan R.

Hopefully I'm trying to get some headers similar to this (if it was GPL v2):

You don't require the _full_ license on each file, just a shortened
one like the one above. In the debian/copyright file I will have
listed a place on the user's system where they can find the licences,
/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL. As long as each sourcefile has some
sort of header with the date of copyright, author & license it
should be OK! Other than that, a new tarball will be required but it
doesn't need to be a new version of the software. Just repackage the
original one and place it on the SF.net download page. Other than
that, I have to write-up a manpage for the project. When I have
finished this manpage, I shall forward back upstream to you if you
wish to include it in your project.

Regards,
Chris.

That's ok for me. I'll merge that into my header proposal.

Wait! The repository already contains a man page, but it has been added
after the 0.9.9 tarball.

You can get it here:
http://hg.berlios.de/repos/crrcsim/raw-file/c0820cd28e4d/documentation/man/crrcsim.1

A tarball of the latest repository tip is here:
http://hg.berlios.de/repos/crrcsim/archive/tip.tar.gz

It needs some minor fixes, then we can create a new 0.9.10 tarball. I'm
currently ironing out some build system issues that were introduced
by the last commits.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Please note that it only compiled, but did not link without CGAL (-lCGAL was
always present in Makefile.am).

This should work now. I've just pushed two changesets with a g++ 4.3.2 compile
error fix and an extended configure.ac that should detect CGAL and check for
libjpeg. I still have to test it on a system that doesn't have these libs
installed (will do this on my Windows box, maybe tomorrow).

If you extend your wind simulation, please use

#if WINDDATA3D == 1

instead of 

#ifdef WINDDATA3D

and include <crrc_config.h> as the first header file in every .cpp file that
uses this macro. Don't include crrc_config.h into ANY header file! The macros
will automatically be present in all header files that are included after
crrc_config.h, so just make sure it's the first included header in any .cpp file.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

One more question: in your proposal, the copyright notice is located
right below the program title. Is there something like a "global"
copyright for the whole program (held by Jan Kansky as the original
author) and individual copyrights for later contributions? In
this case I'd split the header into a unified "legal notice" and
a file-specific header that uses Doxygen syntax:

I pulled a new clone.
./configure ; make is OK on my computer (Windows, msys)

I am completely OK. It is necessary to supplement ModelBasedScenery::
getWindComponents to have a default method of calculating the wind vertical
component. You said to have a proposal for that?

To answer your question, each file that Jan Kansky has authored,
should contain his original copyright and name in the header and any
later contributions should be listed below him with the year of

contributing also. So for example:
/*
....
* Copyright (C) 2000 - Jan Kansky
* Copyright (C) 2005 - Jan Reucker, Philip Morris
* Copyright (C) 2008 - Fredrick Peterson
....
*/

The above shows that the parts added by Fredrick in 2008 as

copyrighted under whatever license (probably GPL) as well as
originally being owned by Jan Kansky in 2000. As long as the
contributions follow the same license as the original file, there is
usually no issue at all regarding the copyrighting. I hope that this

helps. Also if you are going to repack the 0.9.9 tarball, could you
include the manpage and updated copyright headers otherwise I can wait
for 0.9.10 if that is what you wanted. Either way I'll try and package

it ready for Jaunty (the next Ubuntu version).

Chris.

Hi, 

so if I understood Christopher correctly, it is fine to use a header like
this:

/*
 * CRRCsim - the Charles River Radio Control Club Flight Simulator Project
 * Copyright (C) 2000 - Jan Kansky
 * Copyright (C) year - name
 * Copyright (C) year - name
 * ...
 *
 * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 * the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
 * (at your option) any later version.
 *
 * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 * GNU General Public License for more details.

 * You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
 * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
 * Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
 * Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.
 *
 */

I will not use the ', or (at your option) any later version' part in the
files originally created by me, though. No matter how trustworthy the FSF
is, I'm not gonna sign a blank future contract.

Apart from this, can we agree on this header? It's the one suggested by Jan
Reucker, but using the author indication as suggested by Christopher.

Saturday or sunday I'd like to start adding the header to the files created
by me (adding the names of those who edited them afterwards) and adding
appropriate headers to all those files which I created while doing those big
refactorings.

If I add a header, but it is unfinished, I'll add the keyword
'copyrighttodo_jw' to it.

Here is a shellscript which lists dates and contributors to every file in
the current directory (glad to have hg again):

  +--------------------------------------------------------
  | #! /bin/sh
  | 
  | for n in *
  |   do
  |      if test -f $n
  |        then
  |          echo $n
  |          hg log -f -l 9999 --template "   {date|shortdate} {author|user}\n" $n
  |      fi
  | done
  +--------------------------------------------------------



Best regards,
Jens

PS: I'm happy to see that the berlios staff stripped the big changesets and
that they didn't reappear until now!

Yeah that would be perfect the header template. Sorry however about the
mailings going all over the place, I've recently changed my email domain to
be used with gmail and it's taking some time to configure 100% properly. It
is allowed IIRC to remove "or at your option a later version" since you are
specifically stating that your license being used is still GPL v2 but you
don't want to be upgraded just yet. I can't wait to start packaging it. Also
if you are going to repackage the tarball, could you include your manpage in
there too to the current version. Other than that it looks great and
hopefully it'll be ready in time for Jaunty :).

Regards,
Chris.

Hi Joel,

yes, I wrote some code to generate a wind field and used gnuplot to
visualize the resulting wind vectors. Looked quite o.k. to me:

http://crrcsim.berlios.de/wiki/index.php?n=CRRCsim.RedesignWindfield

I still have to integrate this code into CRRCsim, but I think I'll focus
on the Ubuntu packaging right now, which requires some bug fixing and
pushing a 0.9.10 release.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Hi Chris,

repackaging is a bad option, because we changed our version control system
since 0.9.9 and re-organized source files and file locations, so there's
no simple way to merge changes back and forth between 0.9.9 and 0.9.10.
I'd rather like to do all changes in 0.9.10 only, fix the one open bug
reported for 0.9.10 and release this version ASAP. Then you can take
this tarball to create a first version of your package. If we run into
serious problems or discover new bugs, it's fine for me to release a
0.9.11 or even more versions until Jaunty.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

You're right, we should stick with one version of the GPL.

Hehe, that's what I planned to do tonight. I thought I'd write a short perl
script that sorts out the oldest contribution of each author and automatically
outputs the header. But maybe that's over-engineered...

Anyway, I'll start adding headers for "my" files later.

That's exactly what I started, but did not finish tonight because of an
appointment: writing a script/program which automatically adds an header to
a file. I guess it's worth doing it. Maybe tomorrow...

Its perfectly OK to wait until version 0.9.10 for the packaging and updated
header files. In fact it would be better since then you can fix your only
open bug that you have got. You can release as many versions to before
Jaunty and I will try to include them as each new version gets released.
Good luck & have fun with future versions.

Regards,
Chris.

Hi there,

so here is my quick attempt for a script to automatically add a header. It
is _not_ perfect or beautiful, but works -- which is ok for me, given the
number of files which has to be edited and the limited time I have. 

I miss two real names -- does anyone know about them?

Best regards,
Jens

Hi Jens,

it works fine, thanks! I started yesterday to convert the files in GUI
using a half-automated process, and it definitely turned out to be a lot
of work.

One remark: I had to quote the wildcard argument to avoid shell expansion
(so I called:  sh insertheader.sh "src/GUI/*.cpp").

How do we handle multiple contributions in different years? My first thought
was to list only the first contribution of each author, but maybe we should
leave the script output as it is (each author is listed once per year). One
minor flaw is that the original author is listed twice if he contributed to
the file a second time in the same year, but I think this is bearable because
we have to inspect and maybe edit each file by hand anyway after running the
script, e.g. to remove old headers.

> I miss two real names -- does anyone know about them?

s/deffi/Martin Herrmann/

(just try https://sourceforge.net/users/USERNAME/ to find the real names...)

So how do we proceed? Shall we split up the work by directories instead of
looking for our own files only? Just to make sure we edit all files and don't
omit some.

My proposal:
src root	JR
GUI		JR
mod_chardevice	done (own headers)
mod_cntrl	JWW
mod_env		JWW
mod_fdm		JWW
mod_inputdev	JWW
mod_landscape	JR
mod_main	JR
mod_math	JWW
mod_misc	JR
mod_mode	JR
mod_windfield	JR

If this exceeds the amount of time you can spend for CRRCsim this weekend
feel free to reassign more directories to me.

I won't start before friday evening, so if there are more volunteers just
go ahead.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Hi Jan,

I'll start tomorrow and will spend some time, as my girlfriend leaves for
one or two days ;-)

Yes, sounds fine. I plan to change the layout once again, though, in order
to have lines like
 Copyright (C) 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008 Coding Cody
The header is just to long otherwise.

come tomorrow night.

Hi Jens,

I adopted this change and finished GUI and the src root tonight. Changes are
already available at BerliOS.

After I was done with all files, I noticed that your original head2.txt
contained a somewhat strange text passage, so I ran

for n in src/GUI/*.h; do cat $n | sed -e "s/it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by/it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2/" -e "s/the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License./as published by the Free Software Foundation\./" > $n.new;mv $n.new $n; done

on all files. The first paragraph of the header now reads:

 * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
 * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2
 * as published by the Free Software Foundation.

I've tried to recover as much of the file's "C" history as possible. The authors
of some .c files that were converted to .cpp and deleted from CVS are not
preserved in the hg repo (shame on CVS for not providing a "move" command).

Many .c files, however, were broken into pieces or totally rewritten in C++.
Tracking theses changes would be a tedious task, so I didn't care about it.

Status:

src root	done
GUI		done
mod_chardevice	done (own headers)
mod_cntrl	JWW
mod_env		JWW
mod_fdm		JWW
mod_inputdev	JWW
mod_landscape	JR
mod_main	JR
mod_math	JWW
mod_misc	JR
mod_mode	JR
mod_windfield	JR

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Oh, thanks. Obviously I made a mistake when (quickly) changing from "version
2 or later".

So we can't look them up in CVS anymore?

Yeah, that's similar to the previous paragraph: our copyright/author history
is lossy. But I'll think about that later (when I got a feeling of how bad
it is).

Now I'll tune the script...

Hi Jan, 

here's the update. I changed the style in contrast to what Christopher
suggested: it lists authors once, but the year several times. This is what I
saw on other projects, too, and which appears cleaner to me.

You can still look them up (I used the web interface at SF.net which allows you
to show "dead files"). But they're not linked to their .cpp counterparts,
because CVS does not care about moving files. We moved the files locally,
deleted the .c files and added the .cpp files, so the history that is preserved
in hg starts from the point where the file was added as .cpp.

Well, I don't think it's that bad. I think for the fdm_larcsim parts you can
easily lookup the original authors from the "dead" ls_*.[ch] files in CVS.

One thing we don't know, however, is the license under which LarcSim originally
was released. Bruce Jackson didn't provide any licensing information in
his original files. I already talked with Jan K. about this issue. Maybe we
can contact Bruce directly. I guess there shouldn't be any problems, because
other projects like FlightGear also use his code.

Finally, I don't think it's a problem if the history of a couple of files isn't
listed 100% bullet proof in the header. The repositories at SF.net and BerliOS
are open to the public, so anybody interested in the exact history can dig
through it.

Kind regars,
Jan R.

Yes, that's what I did manually for GUI and root tonight. And I slightly adjusted
head1.h so that it no longer produces a blank line above the copyrights.

Great! It's not long until perhaps the package is able to appear in Jaunty when this is complete. Also if you happen to know of any Debian Developers feel free to use "my" diff.gz for an upload to Debian rather than waiting for the Jaunty/Debian synchronisation. When the copyright has finished, I'll keep you up to date with every change that I make via REVU.

Hi all,

So the issue with the missing license headers should be fixed.

Regarding the open bug #015028, I'm currently testing a solution, so expect a
fix to be pushed soon. I found out that it does not only affect joysticks but
all interfaces that can provide more than TX_MAXAXIS axes.

While I did some tests on WinXP I experienced another familiar bug. I thought
it was fixed a long time ago, but now it is back, at least on XP. The
soundserver may segfault when exiting CRRCsim. I guess it's a race condition
when the different threads are shutting down. However, this shouldn't be a
show stopper for the Ubuntu activities as I can't reproduce it on Linux.

Another issue that needs discussion: Should we clean up the list of airplanes
delivered with the base package? I think we should maybe remove some of the
lower quality models (e.g. the "Delta" things that show some very
interesting flat-spinning when handled incorrectly, or models that are
just duplicates of the Allegro FDM parameters) and maybe add one or two
of the higher quality models from crrcsim-addon-models (like the Supra or
the Fireworks III with Bob's fine-tuned FDM parameters).

And what about scenery files?

Kind regards,
Jan R.

It would be logical to replace the old ones ("built-in") by the new ones

So here's my proposal for the models:

allegro.xml      keep
apogee.xml       keep
arkanj-mg11.xml  remove
biplane2.xml     ? (based on sport.xml, but nice to have a biplane)
delta1c.xml      remove
delta1d.xml      remove
delta1e.xml      remove
FlexiflyXLM.xml  keep
gap65.xml        keep
heli.xml         keep
k2-f3f2.xml      ?
k2-f3f.xml       ?
k2.xml           keep
mav0.xml         ?
mav.xml          ?
melyan_01.xml    remove
outrage.xml      keep
quickie01.xml    keep
Skimmer_MK_I.xml remove
Skorpion.xml     keep
sovereign.xml    keep
spirit.xml       remove
sport.xml        keep
superzagi.xml    keep
tug.xml          remove
zagi.xml         ?
zagi-xs.xml      keep
zip60.xml        remove
zipper.xml       keep

And from addon-models:

Crossfire.xml
Erwin.xml
fireworks3_C.xml (with Bob's parameter adjustment)
supra.xml (with Bob's parameter adjustment)

Therefore I'd like to stick with the "built-in" versions, at least for the
next release.

> >> What do you propose for the large files out of HG?

We can serve them from the BerliOS server without storing them in the repo.
I can simply create a .zip file and upload them as a data package. For the
Ubuntu packaging process I'd separate them from the main package. Maybe
Chris can create something like a "crrcsim-extra-data" package. Many projects
seem to do it this way. The base package just provides a basic set of
data files while large addons are offered as a separate download for those
with a broadband connection.

Just when I thought I had fixed the last bug (the soundserver issue, fix not
tested yet, but I guess I know the cause), two more have appeared in the
bug tracker :-(

http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=15138&group_id=9957
http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=15139&group_id=9957

Any help in reproducing and fixing these bugs is appreciated! Regarding
#015139, I think something similar was reported before on one of the mailing lists,
but I never managed to reproduce it.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

I'm not quite sure what you mean though, however if it is about packaging,
feel free to include myself.

Regarding Jan Reucker's email; yes it is possible to have crrcsim-extra-data
if required. There is however one small problem, Ubuntu is going into a
feature freeze at Feb 19th which means that the archive admins may not
process my request if I try to upload after that time. There is a process of
advocation which means that I need 2 other developers to say yes to my
package which can take up to a week but sometimes just 2 days.

Hi,

I mean that we can create a packagers team. You, me and whoever wants to 
package software related to aeromodelism for Debian and/or Ubuntu.

I do not know if it best to use Launchpad or <http://alioth.debian.org/> 
or any forge.

Hi,
Please note that there is already a package for Arch-Linux.
The two packages are currently updated and maitained by me.
Let me know when the update header is completed, I 'll update them 
accordingly.

Other than that, sorry,  I don't have much time to help, I am very busy

Message-ID: <20090130230155.c0d68256.jan.reucker@web.de>

Hi all,

the recently opened bugs #015138 and #015139 have been closed, because they
are already fixed in the current tip. However, when I looked closer at the
joystick configuration dialogs I discovered that Options->Controls->Buttons
still offers the ability to assign functions to axes, although the
underlying functionality has been removed in 2005! I filed a new bug report
for this (#15161), including a proposed fix:

https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&group_id=9957&bug_id=15161

If there are no objections, I'll remove the axis assignment stuff from
the dialog.

Kind regards,
Jan R.

Message-ID: <20090130233855.0ddb860f.jan.reucker@web.de>

Hi all,

I guess it's time to discuss the remaining few steps until we can release
CRRCsim 0.9.10. I've just updated the TaskList in the Wiki
(http://crrcsim.berlios.de/wiki/index.php?n=CRRCsim.TaskList). Here's a
summary of open points:

#1 Verification of spoiler and flap parameters needed. Parameters for more models needed. (coordinated by JWW) 
#2 Verify that configuration of new functions also works on the command line. (open)
#3 Heli-FDM: Verification and/or improvement of FDM parameters needed. (coordinated by JWW) 
#4 Bug #15161 (Axis assignment in Options->Controls->Buttons does not work). (open) 
#5 Unix manpage may need some corrections due to new input functions. (open) 
#6 New scenery selection dialog:should display more information (like airplane selection
  dialog) (open) 
#7 Experimental landscape files should not be part of the final distribution tarball/binary
  packages to avoid confusing the user. Verify autotools scripts. (open) 

And from my recent mail:
#8 List of models needs a cleanup. Remove some, add some from addon-models.


My comments:

#1 no showstopper
#2 I guess that the configuration of axis functions on the command line no
   longer works (see bug #15161: it uses the same internal mechanism which
   was removed 2005). Need to verify this and maybe remove the corresponding
   CLI options.
#3 no showstopper
#4 can be solved within a few days
#5 could be outdated, see #2. Nevertheless, the man page needs some corrections and
   a thorough review.
#6 should be postponed to a later release (quite a bit of work)
#7 needs discussion. I'd say that we only ship cape_cod-orig.xml, davis-orig.xml
   and maybe simple.xml (as an example for potential scenery builders) with the
   tarball and remove the other files from the distribution (by adapting the
   Makefile.am's, not by removing them from the repo).
#8 can be solved within a few days


Kind regards,
Jan R.

Licenses are now in place for the MNAV files. I probably overdid what
needed to be included, especially since the MNAV license is also GPL v2,
but in the end I decided to add the headers from the original files, as
well as some additional info about the license and contact info for the
MNAV author, since neither were in the original file headers.
