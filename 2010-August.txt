Patch to enable model specific input configurations

---------------------------------------------------



Idea: 



Model specific configuration options like mixer settings may help in handling of separate models.

Make usage of existing classes and configuration by writing the config to a different position in the xml file.



GUI:



The input configuration dialog "Controls" was extended by two components.

The first component is a check box indicating if the current configuration is model specific

The second component is a button to enable migration of the current config to either a model 

specific or a global section, depending on the state the configuration is in.

This button is greyed out if the current configuration option matches the configuration file.



The xml file:



The global configuration resides as is in the section <inputMethod /> 

The tag has a new attribute "model_specific=0/1" indicating if the new feature should be used. The old behaviour is model_specific=0.

The model specific input configuration resides in a new tree named <models />

Every model has its own section inside <models /> with the name of the model (i.e. <allegro>)

If the model specific section is not found, the configuration falls back to the global section.



How does it work?



1. Beginning with the xml file from 0.9.11, crrcsim should work as before.

2. Using the controls dialog, the check box "model specific" is unset, the migration button is deactivated

3. Checking the model specific check box will enable the migration button. 

4. When saving configuration, the only change will be the attribute model_specific set to 1. 

   As there is no specific configuration option for the current airplane, the input configuration will remain the same.

5. Hitting the Migration button "--> Model" will now migrate the global input config to a specific config for the current model.

   Save settings and check the xml file. There should be a copy of the input configuration inside the models tag.

6. Every change you do now will affect the model specific settings, not the global one.

7. Selecting a different airplane will start over as before, beginning with the global config, as there is no specific config.

   Migrate and save the setting

8. Switching between airplanes will now load each specific configuration for each airplane.

9. To write the current model specific configuration as a global config back to the file:

   a) uncheck the model specific setting

   b) hit the migration button "--> Global"

   c) Save settings

   You can reenable the model specific configuration thereafter 



Further changes:



- Refactored the crrc_ctrlgen.cpp to have a simple layout scheme with easier calculation of the components



Known issues:



- Still in work

- Before saving the settings, the migration button will reappear each time the controls dialog is opened

- Some debugging printf to be removed

- Ugly usage of global function reconfigureInputMethod in crrc_main from the dialog

- Encapsulation of functionalities needs more work
